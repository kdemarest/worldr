The Fermi Paradox asks the question **"Why don't we see other galactic civilizations?"**

In *Rule Brittania*, the answer is the **"Dark Forest"** option: A ruthless galactic species has sent asteroids with powerful, paranoid beings to all ends of the galaxy. One such landed on Jupiter a mere two million years ago (we're pretty far from galaxy center) and became Jupiter's Great Red Spot. In this game it is called **"The Corruptor."**

In this universe spirits are real, and mediate all supernatural magic. There are **light spirits** helpful to mankind, and **dark spirits** shackled to evil entities that unleash gothic horror upon the mind and body. Bright spirit coalesces when sentience arises, while beasts share broad, generalized spiritual essences.

When the bright, sharp spirits of *Homo Sapiens* arose the Corruptor took notice. Nothing must be allowed to threaten its existence! We were not the first — at least **four other sentient species** (Dolphins, the Ioans, the Moai, and the Zocto) had already fallen, and two more (Venusians and Zayans) would fall shortly.

Humanity invented writing in **3500 BC**, a *yellow flag.*  
In **2500 BC** the first Egyptian pharaohs considered themselves gods, a *red flag.* Driven by dark spiritual energies, the Corruptor is empowered by callousness and murder. It trusts to spiritual powers, not fragile technologies. It is subtle, and patiently works towards a guaranteed end.

Over the next **4,000 years** it undertook its horrible work. It laid the seeds of humanity's destruction — so-called **"Cleansings"**, both quick (asteroids, disease, mega-flooding) and slow (climate change, breeding for non-sentience, nuclear apocalypse).

Its tools are many: spirit powers, slave species (the Moai and Ioans), and the astroturfed **Cult of Purity**. And it has created new tools, forging **seven harmful Wards** that both warp humanity's nature and suppress collaboration to fight back. Anyone hearing the truth about the Corruptor suffers bad luck so extreme that they may not live to see the morning.

In **1817**, when our story opens, six Cleansings are in the works. The Corruptor has infiltrated nearly every savage nation, nearly every religion. Many nations of Europe are also corrupted. **Napoleon**, who warred for 24 years as a secretly enlightened instrument against corruption, has been overthrown and exiled. The **Congress of Vienna** has restored European monarchy, a governmental form most prone to corruption but the only hope for balance.

Our players, loyal citizens of the *(mostly) corruption-free* British Empire, unknowingly enter the fray. Guided by shadowy illuminati, and inheriting the legacy of brilliant minds who have perceived the Corruptor's actions in the past, they are recruited into the struggle to **destroy the Wards** and **fend off the doom of humanity.**

Along the way players must overcome gothic horrors of **body violation, hallucination and madness**.

Ultimately they might **set Jupiter alight as a second sun**, or **create a new god** and face the Corruptor with all the spiritual power of humanity and remaining sentient species at their becks.
