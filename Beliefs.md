# Common Beliefs
No matter your social status, if you were European, you likely believed:

* Miasma, aka "bad vapors", causes disease - notably cholera and fevers
* Astrological predictions guiding health, marriage, farming
* Rats, flies, and maggots spontaneously generate from filth, not reproduction
* Humors (blood, phlegm, black bile, yellow bile) govern health and temperament.
* Bleeding improves most illnesses
* Left-handedness is linked to moral failings or bad luck
* Racial hierarchy is a biological fact. It justifies empire and slavery.
* Women are intellectually inferior by nature. They do not need education, and you don't want to work with one.
* Species were created exactly once, by god, and are unchanging
* Continents don't move - they're made of rock
* The climate has always been like this
* Europe is the center of all history and progress
* Non-European cultures are universally less advanced, and inferior

# Lower Class Beliefs
These beliefs would not be held by the upper classes.

* Ghosts, fairy lore, second sight are active forces in daily life
* Witchcraft and charms can cure sickness or protect livestock
* Seawater is poisonous to drink in all forms (it is just dehydrating)
* Thunderstorms are caused by divine anger rather than electrical discharge
* Comets and eclipses are omens predicting disaster or war
* Earth’s interior is probably hollow or full of vast caverns
* The moon controls mental illness directly (“lunacy”)

# Upper Class Beliefs
If you have a little education, perhaps an aristocratic tutor:

* Since 1807 everyone knows there are eleven planets in the solar system.
* Burning causes the release of flammable "Phlogiston", leaving behind ash. This was disproven by Lavoisier in the 1700s, but only elite scientists understood his work
* Digging downward reveals the past
* Abolition of slavery is a moral question, not a question of empire
* Industrial improvement is our national destiny rather than folk inevitability

# Scientist Beliefs
A rigorous education added these beliefs:

* Electricity is the physical basis of lightning, not divine anger
* No spontaneous generation
* Species may change
* Deep geological time and earth’s age are far beyond biblical chronology
* Earth is not hollow; caverns are geological formations, not a vast internal world
* Vaccination is effective and repeatable
* Combustion involves oxygen
* Meteorites are real rocks from space (accepted scientifically by 1817, still doubted by laymen)
* Mapping, measurement, and specimen collection give reliable knowledge of foreign cultures—not scripture or hearsay
