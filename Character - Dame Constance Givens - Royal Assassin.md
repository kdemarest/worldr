# Dame Constance Givens \- Royal Assassin

## Background

### Where did she grow up?

*Part 1 \- The Streets of London*

Constance grew up as a pickpocket on the streets of London.  Her quick wits and nimble fingers allowed her to survive, but no one really flourishes on the streets.  Her fortunes took a dramatic turn when she nic’d the purse of a lady one afternoon near Crown Street.  The grab, she thought, went perfectly \- the lady did not react in any way, and Constance slipped away into the crowd just as she had done hundreds of times before.  She spent the coin she found on food and shoes, then made her way back to a burned-out building she had been using as a lair for about a week.  As she settled in for the night, she was shocked to hear a woman’s voice speak pleasantly from the shadows: “You are a slippery little fox, aren’t you?”

Constance got ready to bolt, but paused when the woman continued to speak:  “I’m not going to hurt, my dear.  In fact, I think I might be able to help you”

The woman was Lady Margaret Collinsworth, an agent of the Alien Office.  Lady Margaret had been watching young Constance for some time, assessing her talents and potential for recruitment and training.  They spoke until well past dark and, in the end, Constance left with Lady Margaret to bein her new like

*Part 2 \- Covington House*

Constance spent the next several years at a stately residence in London called Covington House.  She was one of six children who had been recruited by Lady Margaret; four boys and two girls.  The children quickly learned that they were being groomed for very important and very secret work.  The good King and Country was drilled into them, and they developed a powerful pride for the British Empire.  The children were trained in a wide variety of skills.  Constance excelled in marksmanship and skullduggery.

### What were her parents like?

Lady Margaret became Constance’s surrogate mother.  Constance was the first child selected for Lady Margaret’s program and held a special place for her.  She encouraged and pushed young Constance to achieve the full potential she had seen in her.  She did not allow Constance to give up on anything.  Always forward.  Always better.

The other young assassins were:

1. Cassius Shaw \- KIA on the peninsula  
   1. Very close relationship with Constance  
   2. Dashing and charismatic.  Silver-tongued.   
   3. Was captured and executed by Napoleon’s forces  
2. Percy Moore \- MIA in Austria  
   1. Arrogant, misogynist prick.   
   2. Highly competent \- almost as good as Constance, though he would never admit to being second to a lowly woman  
   3. Constance disliked him, but was counseled by Lady Margaret to use his constant pressure as a motivator to excel  
   4. Percy succeeded in eliminating his target in Austria, but failed to return to England.  Efforts to locate him have failed  
3. Thaddeus Bennet \- KIA in Ireland  
   1. Cold-blooded killer.  Constance felt he got too much of a thrill from murdering and went out of his way to include additional casualties.    
   2. He was very effective though and Constance respected his ability to get the job done.  
   3. Despite his “enthusiasm”, he and Constance got along quite well.   
   4. He was killed in an explosion while preparing for a job against a radical religious leader in Ireland.  An investigation suggests that a gunpowder barrel that he was preparing ignited prematurely and he was caught in the blast.   
4. Virgil Wright \- Alive  
   1. Calm and careful assassin.  He is a meticulous planner.  
   2. Constance believes he tends to waste a lot of time trying to prepare for every eventuality, while he considers her a little reckless.  They do get along very well, though, and share a deep pride in the work that they do and their accomplishments.  
   3. Like Constance, he was knighted after Waterloo.  
5. Sadie Turner \- MIA in Wales  
   1. Constance’s best friend and confidant. Sadie and Constance consider each other sisters.  
   2. Friendly, beautiful, and outgoing.  Proved to be an excellent infiltrator.  
   3. Favored using poisons and specialized in making her kills look like natural occurrences or accidents.  
   4. Disappeared while infiltrating a Welsh nobleman’s estate who was suspected of collaborating with the French.  

### What is she proud of?

Constance is very proud of her final kill in the service of the Alien Office.  She was operating on the peninsula and had been tasked with eliminating one of Napoleon's top lieutenants.  It was a difficult job that culminated with an amazing shot from a great distance.  She is a little sad that she can’t share the story of her greatest achievement with anyone outside the family.

### What defines her identity?

Constance sees herself as the silent blade of the Empire.  She believes in the vision of the British way of life and that all people around the world would be better off under British rule.  She does not see herself as an operational planner, though.  She trusts others to identify who should be eliminated or what information should be acquired.  She sees herself as a tool to be wielded by the righteous.

### What does she fear deeply?

Glossophobia \- Constance is terrified of the thought of public speaking.

### What is a playable character flaw?

Withdrawn \- Constance avoids social interactions whenever possible.  She much prefers moving about unseen.

### How is she unsuited for British life?

Constance has spent her life training as an assassin.  Now that the Alien Office has shut down, she finds herself unsure of what to do next.  The idea of marrying into a nice home is horrifying.  There has to be something more for someone with her skills.

## Growth

Constance has only known conflict her entire life.  As a child, she fought to survive on the streets of London.  In her youth, she was trained to fight and kill for the glory of the Empire.  As a young woman, she exercised those skills to great effect.  She has little understanding or appreciation for a richer life.

As the campaign progresses, Constance will be exposed to a wide tapestry of peoples and cultures.  She will likely start to gain a better appreciation for a brighter world outside of the focused life she has lived.

## Relic

Constance has an uncanny ability to be in the right place at the right time in regards to completing her mission.  Perhaps she’ll happen to overhear a conversation about where her target will be the following day, or she’ll have an intuitive feeling about an unlikely place to set up for a perfect shot.
