**Name:** Gahan Forsythe

**Role:**

* Man of Action  
  * Stow Away

**Background**:

* 1799: Gahan's parents moved to London in 1799 while Gahan's Mother, Isla, was pregnant with Gahan. His father Ewan was ready to make a name for himself in London, a devout follower of Hume and Smith. Ewan was having a tough time in London, finding work was hard. Isla was able to get a job as a washerwoman, but that brought in very little income. They were scraping by, but Ewan always kept a positive attitude that hard work would win out.  
* 1800: Gahan was born Tuesday April 1, 1800 and Christened Gahan Hume Smith Forsythe. Three days later his father disappeared while on an errand. Isla was worried, but was unable to find him and the authorities seem unconcerned. Ewan never returned.  
* 1800 September: Isla learns that her husband was hit by a horse and carriage while traversing the streets of London. He was carrying: An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals (Hume), An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations (Smith), and a cheap pocket watch. His items were kept together and sold at auction the winner, a kindly old scholar, noticed the inscription in the cover of Wealth of Nations, and noticed it was actually an address in London. As a man of letters he felt obligated to return the contents to Isla, and inform her of her husband's tragic fate. Isla keeps the books and watch for little Gahan's inheritance.  
* 1807 February 23, While out to pick up a basket of clothing, Isla is caught in the crowd of a public hanging. She is crushed to death along with 39 other people.  
* 1807 February 24: Gahan leaves his house looking for his mother. He takes his father's pocket watch with him for safety.  
* 1807 February to April: Life is a haze, Gahan has managed to keep his watch, but has been pommeled with hunger, cold, fear, and beatings at the hand of other street children. This changes when he meets Constance, an older child who takes him under her wings. He learns to build his own lair, and with her guidance becomes an adept pick pocket. He is still wary of her, because of his other experiences, but checks in with her about once a week. He never tells her where his lair is.  
* 1808: Constance disappears. Gahan is sad, but this is just life on the streets, and at this point he has enough experience to stay alive by never being seen, and taking what is necessary. He avoids conflict as much as possible, but learns to hold his own if needed…  
* 1808 to 1817: Gahan adapts and learns. Discovers he is a little brighter than the other children, and takes a longer view of their exploits. He realizes at 17, even though he looks young for his age, he is too old to continue this way of life. He doesn't know how to get out of it. He is desperate for any opportunity. An older criminal, Dante, who sometimes gives him work asks him to scout a ship on the docks. It is apparently a huge expedition, and the take would be quite handsome, and his share, for easy work, will be large. Gahan sees it as the opportunity he has been waiting for. A week before he is supposed to check the supplies on the ship, he finds a group of other street children are raiding his lair. This has happened before, but normally they just take his food, these children are stealing his copies of Hume and Smith, Gahan cannot read, but he remembers those books as being his father's, and has learned to recognize Hume and Smith's names. Even though these are not the original copies of his father, Gahan nicks a copy of them when he can, this infuriates Gahan who goes in swinging. He probably could have taken them, but as soon as he entered his lair he was ambushed from behind. They beat him soundly, and he lost consciousness. He woke hours later, and everything in his lair had been taken. His father's watch was laying on his chest, but the cover was dented and the glass on the face broken.

    

**Where did they grow up?**  
London  
**What were their parents like?**  
Hard working, smart, but poor.  
**Who (or what) did they lose, that mattered to them?**  
Isla lost her Husband, Gahan mattered to her more than anything, but she often spoke of the dreams of Ewan, who was a proud, but poor scholar. Gahan learned that books were important, but Isla had not yet learned to read, so Gahan didn't either. Gahan of course lost both of his parents, and the safety of a loving home.  
**What are they proud of?**  
Self sufficiency and hard work. Ewan was proud of the contributions of Scottish writers like Hume and Smith to the knowledge of the world. Isla passed this onto Gahan. Gahan hopes to be more than a thief someday. He has also taken the kindness of Constance to heart, and tries to mentor the younger kids where he can.  
**What defines their identity?**  
    \- Scottish Ancestry, living on the streets, wary of strangers  
**What do they fear deeply?**  
Mazeophobia: Gahan would study maps of London once he was old enough to understand them. He couldn’t read the street names, but used them for landmark based navigation.  
**What is their addiction/obsession/compulsion?**  
Gahan has learned to love stealing, it is as comforting as food, and as exciting as sex.  
**What social class? What magnitude of wealth?**  
Definitely lower class  
**If you are lower class, enumerate some sideline capabilities you might have gotten from your family or community.**   
    \- Stealth, lock picking, pickpocket, deception etc.  
**What "delicate arts" do you have, for example were you trained in painting, an instrument, dance, cooking, witty repartee, etc?**  
Fast talking  
**What is their role-playable character flaw? (See RB Character Flaws)**

* Illiterate  
* Fraudulent against those not his own (which is most people)

**What are you running from or in what way unsuited to British life?**

* Running from Poverty. is only up on the knowledge of the day in so much that it gives him an edge on the street (or fast talking his way out of a jam).  
* Scottish Ancestry sometimes gives him trouble, but his accent is pure London.

**What practical expeditionary skill are you cross-trained in? This training can be before the voyage, or during a short period just before and during the voyage.**

* Nimble, would be a natural on the rigging with a little training.  
* A thief, if we need something stolen. Is good at understanding guard rotations, ingress and egress, locks (but not safes) etc.
