# Cleansings (World Endings)

The Corruptor, having attempted natural extermination like Mt Tambora and deadening the mind by mixing humanity with creatures, has turned to using humanity to kill itself over long periods of time. The C has studied humanity in great, minute and aching detail. While it fails to see some human qualities (loyalty, love) it easily perceives many others that humanity chooses to stay ignorant of. It uses this model of the human mind to devise cleansings that humanity can bring upon itself.

Revelations gradually reveal these potential cataclysms to the players:

## I. Cleansing by Filth
**Overheating**  
Carbon consumption driving climate change, started 1859. England's upcoming Industrial Revolution

## II. Cleansing by Life
**Pandemic**  
Biotechnology & genetically modified organisms and engineered pandemic, and/or nanotechnology weapons.

## III. Cleansing by Futility
**Torpor**
Machinery/AI rendering humans purposeless by making them redundant.

## IV. Rediant Cleansing
**Nuclear War**
Mutual destruction by nuclear war, and the attendant fallout.

## V. Cleansing by Dust
**Asteroid Strike**
A rock 12 miles wide hurtles towards earth. The impact will blot out the sun for decades.

## VI. Cleansing by Vigor
**EcoLapse**
Ecological collapse due to overpopulation, over-consumption, and abuse of the commons abuse

## VII. Cleansing by Fitness
**Invasives**  
An invasive species, like carp and the Great Lakes, simply out-competes humanity.

Note: Overheating has the corollary effect of melting the Zocto Ice Wards.

Note: There have also been failed attempts to devise a cleansing. The Scroll of Changing is one example.
