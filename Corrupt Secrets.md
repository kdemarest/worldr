# Corrupt Secrets

The First Ward of the Corruptor brings woe to any who share Corrupt Secrets. From a game perspective, this mechanism intends to stop open player communication about the corruptor. Players should fear to speak about it, and quickly hush other players, bringing an aura of menace and risk to the game.

Corrupt Secrets include:
* All knowledge about the Corruptor, including its existence or speaking of it in any way
* Most knowledge of magical arts and capabilities, abilities, reagents, etc.
* Anything occult that might enable action against the corruptor

The GM will know Corrupt Secrets when she hears them.

Upon conveying Corrupt Secrets, or even hearing them, a sentient becomes a Pariah, and given a Pariah Rank equal to the degree of violation - T1 through T6 as judged by the GM.

Negative energy called "malefaction" then accumulates around a pariah until it is suddenly released in a way that harms the pariah and what he values.

**Step 1:** Accumulate Malefaction

Every action the pariah must roll Chaos Resistance against their Rank. Failure adds one point of  malefaction. Upon rolling a 1 the malefaction manifests into some kind of terrible, chaotic event of a tier equal to the malefaction. Such things most often hinder the victim, but sometimes they inflict damage.

**Step 2:** Store the Malefaction.

The GM will keep the malefaction as a Mal Event until a time suitable to bring proper harm. Repeated transfer of Corrupt Secrets builds up malefaction quickly, but note, that even vast crimes against the Secrets matter little if those involved will soon be dead, or brain damaged.

**Step 3:** Repeat

Return to Step 1 until total malefaction in all Mal Events is at least equal to the Pariah Rank.

**Step 4:** Suffer

At a time judged best by the GM, the Mal Events manifest. Typical releases of malefaction include:

* Curses - See _curses_ for details.
* Mental - from sudden confusion, to madness, or a self-harming rage.
* Physical - from a collapsing roof, to a lightning strike out of a blue sky, to choking on ones' own saliva, to a twisted bowel that kills the pariah
