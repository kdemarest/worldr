## Dark Stars

The Dark Stars are black holes about a centimeter around encased in a diamond shell. Black holes were posited as "Dark Stars" by [John Mitchell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Michell) in 1783 based on Newton's theory of light. There is one such Dark Star, also called a Warding Heart, at the center of each Ward Storm.

As manipulators of light, Dark Stars are intimately connected to Ether and to the Spirit world.

The Wards are also known as the "seven stars in jupiter", and were given the names of arch-angels in Christianity; The names of the seven archangels who lead the angelic host are: Saint Michael, Saint Gabriel, Saint Raphael, Uriel, Raguel, Zerachiel, and Remiel.

King David is the metaphorical name of a human king who found one of the Warding Hearts and wore it, giving him great power over spirits.
