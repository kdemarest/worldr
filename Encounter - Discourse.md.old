# **\!Discourse Topics**

When meals are eaten together, especially in a captain's cabin and such, Erudite topics naturally arise:

* **Hard Times** \- What is to blame for the ongoing economic slump? The factories, the government, the Year without a Summer, Luddites and Spencians?  
* **Universal male suffrage**, as only 11% of the men of England can currently vote, and in Manchester only 1.7% vote. [Pocket Boroughs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotten_and_pocket_boroughs) can be bought by wealthy patrons. (Male suffrage won't be achieved for 100 years)  
* **Militarized Police** \- Is the formation of the [Manchester Yeomanry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_and_Salford_Yeomanry) proper? The Manchester Yeomanry cavalry was a short-lived yeomanry regiment formed in response to social unrest in northern England in 1817\. The volunteer regiment became notorious for its involvement in the 1819 Peterloo Massacre, in which as many as 15 people were killed and 400–700 were injured.  
* **Laplace's demon** \- An articulation of causal determinism. If you know the location, speed etc of every atom in the universe, is the future known and deterministic?  
* **Romanticism**: Is the world of feeling superior to reason? Nature superior to machines. The past better than the present. We all feel the pull of tradition, the nostalgia for a noble past. Reason is cold and uncaring, and subverts the feelings we all have about god, the king, and nations.  
* **The Poor:** John Pounds has started a Ragged School for poor children. Can you imagine? What would they do with a book but burn it for heat? Indeed. But that Jews Free School \- I hear Moses Angel is a curly headed genius...  
* **Individualism**: When Rousseau wrote about his individual emotions, is he not denying the communalism and cooperation required by any society to function, to surpass rivals, and to maintain security against foes? Is this not a denial of duty to sovereign? But Nelson is a Great Man who changed the course of History. As was Napoleon.  
* **Christain Repbulic a Paradox?** Rousseau, in the Social Contract, implied that the concept of a [Christian republic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_republic) was paradoxical since Christianity taught submission rather than participation in public affairs.

* **Marriage**: Should one marry for alliance and practicality, or for love? What if that love brings ruin to the family fortunes? What is the love's family is a horror.  
* **Dueling**: traditional and proper way to settle a matter of honor? "A man may shoot the man who invades his character, as he may shoot him who attempts to break into his house.”  
* **Natural Law Eliminates Free will**: Schopenhauer: humans have no free will. They are completely determined by the way that their bodies react to stimuli and causes, and their characters react to motives.  
* **Will Drives the World**: God does not drive the world: the inner essence of everything is "will": a blind, unconscious, aimless striving devoid of knowledge, outside of space and time, and free of all multiplicity. The world as representation is, therefore, the ‘objectification’ of the will. Aesthetic experiences release a person briefly from his endless servitude to the will, which is the root of suffering.  
* **Laissez-faire economics**: Merchantilism (theory that trade generates wealth and is stimulated by the accumulation of profitable balances, which a government should encourage by means of protectionism) vs an invisible hand (the tendency of free markets to regulate themselves by means of competition, supply and demand, and self-interest.)  
* **Industry**: How will the rise of factories and new forms of trade alter society? Can we factory-ize farming? Politics? If cities continue to grow, what will happen to the blissful agrarian societies and the old wealth nobility that rules over them? Is being a merchant the "new game in town" that will compete even with royalty?  
* **Source of Morality**: Where does morality come from? How do we know right from wrong? Smith: conscience arises from dynamic and interactive social relationships through which people seek "mutual sympathy of sentiments." The feedback we receive from perceiving (or imagining) others' judgment creates an incentive to achieve "mutual sympathy of sentiments" with them and leads people to develop habits, and then principles, of behaviour, which come to constitute one's conscience  
* **Natural Rights** \- all men are created equal, endowed by their creator with natural rights.  
* **Right to Overthrow** \- when government isabusive of the people, those people should replace the government. "When in the Course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another, and to assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation."  
* **Origin of Races**: Are all races descended of Adam and Eve? Why then are they differing colors? Monogenism, Pre-Adamism; Co-Adamism; Serpent Seed; Chemist Robert Boyle (a monogenist) believed human beings, no matter how diverse their physical differences, came from the same source: Adam and Eve. He studied albinos, so he concluded that Adam and Eve were originally white and that Caucasians could give birth to different coloured races. Francis Dobbs (died 1811), an eccentric member of the Irish Parliament, claimed in his Concise View from History written in 1800 that there was a race resulting from a clandestine affair between Eve and the Serpent, that of Cain, and some people (Jews) are the result of this union.  
* DONE Does "**natural authority**"exist, that is, do some have an intrinsic right to rule? Rousseau: Man is born free and everywhere he is in chains; No man has any natural authority over his fellow men; Nature never deceives us; it is we who deceive ourselves.  
* DONE **Physiognomy** \- the belief that a person's outer appearance, especially the shape and lines of their face, could reveal their inner character. See Joseph Ducreaux.  
* **Predestination**: Is all activity in the universe God's will, or does man have choice? Luther and other reformers proposed that humanity was stripped of free will by [sin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sin) and that divine [predestination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predestination) ruled all activity within the mortal realm. They held that God was completely omniscient and omnipotent; that anything which happened had to be the result of God's explicit will, and that God's foreknowledge of events in fact brought the events into being. Erasmus' [On Free Will](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_libero_arbitrio_diatribe_sive_collatio) Erasmus however argued that foreknowledge did not equal predestination. Instead, Erasmus compared God to an [astronomer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomer) who knows that a [solar eclipse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_eclipse) is going to occur. The astronomer's foreknowledge does nothing to cause the eclipse—rather his knowledge of what is to come proceeds from an intimate familiarity with the workings of the cosmos. Erasmus held that, as the creator of both the cosmos and mankind, God was so intimately familiar with his creations that he was capable of perfectly predicting events which were to come, even if they were contrary to God's explicit will.
