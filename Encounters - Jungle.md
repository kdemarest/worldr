# !Jungle Standard Hazards

1. **Rash 5 days:** Reddish, diamond-shaped bugs swarm on a tree = hand and finger joint rash hinders all tasks that involve hands  
2. **Wobbly 3 days:** Rotted log with blue fungus = biting aphids make wobbly legs, hindering all tasks involving legs  
3. **Swollen 1–3 days:** Head-height spider web with a yellow spider that stings and dramatically swells up the face = −3 perception; must roll 4 to speak and be understood  
4. **Hallucinate 1 day:** Brown fungus touched and then touch the face = hallucinations; must be led through the jungle or will wander off track. Roll 4 to spend any Int effort.  
5. **Worms forever:** Crossing a stream you carelessly touch your mouth = Intestinal worms. As long as you have them, your maximum Might will be reduced by 4 points (see Siamese Cassia for cure) 4 to diagnose. Cures with fresh water clams from the deep mud of the river.  
6. **Scabies 5 days:** You didn’t properly clear your sleeping area last night. Contract Scabies, a horribly itchy skin-burrowing mite. Once a day, unless you can control it with will power, you will erupt in extreme annoyance over a minor matter. Your maximum Speed will be reduced by 2 points. If untreated, the itch subsides and then spreads to other party members (See Siamese Cassia for a cure)  
7. **Malaria 3 days:** You develop flu-like symptoms. Cost of all Effort is doubled. Roll 2 to avoid cerebral complications that halve your Int pool. If you use effort to resist this, it costs double and is consumed for the duration of the disease. If you suffer cerebral problems, roll 2 again to avoid death.  
8. **Quicksand T2**
