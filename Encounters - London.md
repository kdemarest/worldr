# **\!Encounters**

## \!London Streets

1. **Philosophy**: Upon an overturned soap box, a man stands with a sign: "If you see it not, it exists not." He proclaims loudly that there is no "invisible world". If pressed he will denounce god and the church as trying to control the masses. A gathering crowd begins to throw mud, then rotten vegetables, then stones.  
2. **Troubles**: See a horse keeled over, attended by the carriage man who bemoans the wet cold summer, the damp oat harvest and these damnable dark skies.  
3. **Unstable**: See a Spencean handbill posted. It begins "England expects every man to do his duty\!" and continues with [this text](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spa_Fields_riots#Rioting).  
4. **Unstable**: Walk by a lace factory with smoke coming out. A luddite attack has crashed the gears. People run out of the factory \- did they do it?  
5. **Unjust**: A burly man picks up two eight year old children and hauls them away to the factory where they work, complaining that they can idle on their own time.  
6. **Progress**: A man struts by on a [Dandy Horse](https://tbeartravels.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/13-dandy-horse1.jpg), proclaiming that the age of horse is at an end  
7. **Flavor**: A beggar sits upon a street corner, calling for alms. You realize it is [Lambert](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ml4MhMjmapNTFYD-ifeZb_XncwotmAcRF9zSmtC7zb0/edit#bookmark=id.a4ae3uhuc2my), from the cricket match. If you chat, he will tell of being banned from play by Beauclerk's malign lies. Those witnesses were bought and paid for\!  
8. **DONE Class**: A noble carriage passes, with young men hangers-on standing upon the running boards  
9. **Class**: Meet a bone grubber ([link](http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=zGNNAAAAcAAJ&pg=PA139&dq=%22bone+grubber%22&hl=en&sa=X&ei=Tt3tT4myGKO60QXdlY3-DQ&ved=0CDQQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=%22bone%20grubber%22&f=false))  
10. **Class**: A flyer drifts down the street on the wind, coming to land upon your chest. When you pull it away, you working class politics: [PIC](https://userscontent2.emaze.com/images/1cb567d8-9ef4-4df4-b24a-bd7ef4af1c8e/e208efa6-5f9a-4f1b-b96e-9d38d6a14ddc.jpg)  
11. **History**: A street puppet show demonstrates Maitland taking Napoleon's surrender. Children throw pebbles at Napoleon.  
12. **History**: A watchman [PIC](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/f6/bb/5c/f6bb5c43e8deb6539220b61a4d4a8f72.jpg) known as a Charlie walks past. (50% chance he has a dog) Wrapped up against the weather, he holds out a lantern in one hand and a man-high cudgel in the other. He cries out the time, then greets you cordially. He has seen a few years \- any child could outrun him \- but his eyes tell that he saw military action in younger days. If you can catch the criminal, Charlie will know where to go next.  
13. **Medical:** An Irish beggar woman, dying from the common cold, begs you to take her baby. She tells her story: everyone in her family killed by Typhus in the Year Without a Summer. 100,000 Irish dead from Typhus.  
14. **DONE Medical**: A stumbling beggar is said to have the pox. Students flee to the far side of the street. (smallpox is killing 400,000 Europeans annually) but a passing professor tells him "I say. You poxy beggar. Go see Jenner on Marshfield Road. Marshfield road\!" he shouts.  
15. **\*\*\*\* Medical**: See a ship burned in the harbor (or the smoke plume). Returning from Calcutta carrying British soldiers, they had fallen to cholera from the pandemic that started there. Better safe than sorry.  
16. **Crime**: A lady falls. As you help her up, your pocket is picked.  
17. **Crime**: An entry point to somewhere is stalled by a small crowd. As you are forced to wait, your pocket is picked.  
18. **Crime**: A man wails in the stocks. He begs for water and a bit of food. He tells a different story about what crime he committed to each person who asks, depending on how they look.  
19. A woman calls "Hot Codlins\! Hot Codlins\!" She is selling hot apples. [PIC](https://www.fromoldbooks.org/RandMcnally-RealMotherGoose/pages/Hot-Codlins/Hot-Codlins-q100-768x1247.jpg)  
20. So-called "pure finder" collects dog poop to sell to tanners for tanning hides  
21. [Father Kensington](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ml4MhMjmapNTFYD-ifeZb_XncwotmAcRF9zSmtC7zb0/edit#bookmark=id.anz67d85vo91) stands in a nearby alley. A tall brazier heats a large pot of soup, and a stack of stale bread rests nearby. Children are lined up holding soup bowls. He is arguing with a brawny older boy (Old Farm), perhaps 14 years old, not to take food from the younger children.

## \!London Wealthy

1. *A group of fabulously dressed men and women stands on a large terrace elevated above the street. The fashion is new, energetic and eye-catching. You suspect the man on the left could be Beau Brummel, the Prince Regent's fashion tsar.* [PIC](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e9/Almacks_with_Brummell.jpg)  
2. **Class**: A noble carriage passes, with young men hangers-on standing upon the running boards  
3. **Progress**: A strange hiss erupts from a nearby alley. When you enter: *You can see a muddy, dirty workman unconscious. Blood matts the hair on his head. A pickaxe lies in the mud near his feet. A dug hole about two feet long and a foot wide has uncovered a pipe, and some gas under pressure is issuing from that pipe.* GM: it is a gas pipe. He hit his head when the gas overcame his lungs.  
4. **Progress**: A man struts by on a [Dandy Horse](https://tbeartravels.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/13-dandy-horse1.jpg), proclaiming that the age of horse is at an end  
5. **Philosophy**: A man with a tricorn hat and American clothing, with an upper class woman beside him, argues forcefully with a rather tipsy looking aristocrat. "She has as much right as you to learn, to own property, to have equal rights. You can't even see that what you consider "polite society" is nothing more than oppression of women\!" etc. It is John Neal, women's rights lecturer, who is visiting London. He will later influence John Stuart Mill, who regards the history of women (and most men) as one of subjugation which must end.  
6. **Philosophy**: Pass a pub with outdoor tables. Two university students sit outside arguing whether the "social contract" can apply to savage nations where force is all they understand  
7. **DONE Style**: *A phaeton [PIC](https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ySza7PHS7-0/XRN5Cck6fcI/AAAAAAAAsLQ/ROo4DoTmUloQVvzMbRMZhRJwXhrNpXR0ACLcBGAs/s1600/Two_Ladies%252C_en_neglige%252C_taking_an_airing_in_a_phaeton_-_The_Gallery_of_Fashion%252C_August_1794.jpeg) driven by a butler and occupied by a young couple with a lap dog in the latest high street garments travels in elegance towards you along the cobbled street. The swept lines, oversized wheels, black calf leather seats and finely tuned springs tell you it is new, expensive and fashionable. The lap dog barks, and a mangy cur barks loudly in return. The horse spooks, the reins are torn from the carriageman's hand, and the carriage begins to careen towards you.* It is Beau Brummel and Frederica duchess of York, who is carrying her little dog Fidélité, just gifted from Brummel.  
8. A scandal sheet reveals how Lord Byron escaped England by the skin of his teeth, and is rumored to be in the Villa Diodati [LINK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Villa_Diodati). The scandal of his separation from [his wife](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anne_Isabella_Byron,_Baroness_Byron), rumours of an affair with [his half-sister](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augusta_Leigh), and ever-increasing debt, had forced him to leave England, never to return, in April of that year.[\[](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Villa_Diodati#cite_note-3)

## \!London Riverside

50% chance for a regular London Street encounter

1. **Dead Pig** *\- The body of a dead pig, swollen and distended, has snagged on a pole in the water. Children throw stones at it while an old woman encourages them. The smell is terrible, driving customers away from her fish stand. She asks for help to get the body gone.* Delicate\! Or it will explode. The pig is 12' from the docks, in 4' deep water. A nearby rowboat stands unused, but the current is moving pretty fast.  
2. **Rat Swarm** \- *A huge swarm of 200 rats suddenly gathers, and just as suddenly launches into the Thames, swimming across as fast as they can paddle. A strange, ultra-deep [growl](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCx8oFETyDQ) can be heard from the sewer grate nearby. Perhaps that is what frightened the rats?* It is an alligator that has escaped from the zoo.  
3. **DONE Holywell Street \-** You have reached Holywell Street [MAP](https://www.google.com/maps/place/St+Mary+Le+Strand+Church/@51.512249,-0.1181227,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x487604b59666d4e1:0x9e12b94a2fd2af4a!8m2!3d51.5122457!4d-0.115934)  
   *Crooked timber-framed houses with gables lurch over the street, blocking out the light, as though untouched from medieval times. Old wooden-fronted, deep-bayed buildings proudly wear grime, dilapidation and, some might say, a certain moral dissolution. Books abound on trestle tables, hastily set up shelves, seemingly overflowing from the packed shop windows as busy presses thrive in the new abundance of factory-made paper. Horse-drawn carts load and unload yet more books, as shop owners chivvy men to be careful, don't let mud on the edges. Nearby, a golden crescent moon with pouting lips, thick eyebrows, a fine nose, and sad, sulky eyes, hangs before a shop just as stuffed as all the others. It guards the entrance to legendary Half-Moon Passage, a dark alley reeking of urine, leading to the more "legitimate" stores where the unsavory content of risque books is not allowed.*

1. 1d4 Toshers (sewer hunters)
