# !Sea Encounters
1. Nature: a) Oar fish (pic), or b) Shark Swarm of emerging fins, or c) a White Whale with harpoons stuck into it, d) A large population of crabs is found thriving among the ballast. Good eating!
2. Nature: a) Blobs of grey goop float by. Ambergris, b) sparkling ball lightning dances along the sails
3. Nature: A huge lump of water approaches the ship, raising it so fast that ears pop, then dropping down just as quickly. A tidal wave, but from where?
4. DONE Castaways: a) Natives lost to sea from a storm, or b) a shipwrecked European clings to a raft claiming he is a Russian prince dumped at sea by his vizier. He speaks perfect English, but his Russian is non-existent, which he explains is a curse.
5. Weather: a) Deep fog of unseasonable temperature. Frost forms on everything. Slips. Animal death. Humans will die unless warmed/huddle, b) Sparkling, beautiful day, c) Storm. Roll severity.
6. DONE Ship: A ship returns to Britain from darkest Africa. A young woman holds the hand of a strange man, who acts like an ape.

8. Encounter: Night watch: sucker marks lead over the railing. Someone is missing...
9. Encounter: Phosphorescence seen in the water in the evening. It feels like you're fated. Sudden stillness calms the water. Later that evening, whoever is on midnight watch sees deep below lights as of a city sparkling in the depths.
10. Encounter: The ship runs gently aground on a sand hump, right in the middle of the ocean. All hands must rig ropes and haul/push it off.
11. Nature: A strange thing floats nearby - iceberg remnant with a white bear, huge pumice boulder, enormous desiccated tree.
12. DONE Flavor: Captain knows it is the cook's birthday. Breaks out mead and dried anchovies to celebrate.
