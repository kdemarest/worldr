
## Adventures

* **Constance** sees evidence of betrayal by Gahan, but it is faked or coincidental. Father Kensington visits her dreams.  
* **Constance** and **Bolton** must run the crew through cannon training and a mock boarding exercise.  
* **Henton** gets a pillow allergy, and compulsively checks the contents of wardrobes. He begins to have difficulty not knowing what is inside containers.  
* **Gahan** a rude sailor decides he doesn't like him "putting on airs" as a passenger. "Yer nit better'n me". Eventually frames him for theft.  
* **Bolton** sees a sailor that strikes his fancy, either by bravery, strength, or a display of immaculate good character.  
* **William** is asked to assist repairing a ship [mechanical system](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ml4MhMjmapNTFYD-ifeZb_XncwotmAcRF9zSmtC7zb0/edit#bookmark=id.ekd8uy42dmh5)  
* **William** is consulted by Mr. Mump on some mathematical problems of optics, how to judge the focal length of a lens, and angles of refraction.  
* **William** must deal with removing a toe crushed by a boom.  
* **Lucius** must teach swimming. How will he get the "safely" in the water to try it?  
* Crewman Johann **Georg Heidler** (a patrilineal grandfather of Adolph Hitler) charms the crew with a fevered speech, seven of whom become thralls, and the rest become apathetic. Players might detect the threat. Some will be overpowered, and have to escape. Some might hide and sneak. If Georg is not killed he is set adrift. If he is killed, it will be on deck where he can conveniently fall overboard.  
* **Beard** fleeces a crew member during a long, frustrating lull, and there is a big fight, that spreads willy nilly across the ship. The Captain sleeps through it.  
* **Old Salt** whittles a masterpiece. He'll teach any that wish to learn.  
* **Bully Buster** has been threatening Stinky Pete and taking his beer ration. Pete passes out. It is dehydration. The captain has Pete punished with three days in the brig on a diet of [bread and water](https://www.history.com/news/navy-bread-and-water-ban-sailor-punishment). Pete thanks him. Buster shows up next day with bruises all over his belly. Overnight he was strapped, gagged, hooded, and blackjacked by the rest of the crew to let him know treating Pete that way wasn't OK.
