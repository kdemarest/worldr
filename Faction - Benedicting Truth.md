FACTION: THE BENEDICTINE TRUTH

Around 500 CE Benedict of Nursia discovered the activity of the Corruptor. To free himself from all corruption he became a hermit, and when ready, founded the first Benedictine monastery.

He then created a covert organization within the Catholic church to covertly counter the corruption in the papacy, called the Veritas Benedictum or simply the Veritasium. This covert organization hides in plain sight, operating among the lower echelons of Benedictine monks.

For over a thousand years it has sought to counter the Corruptor in Europe. Achievements include:
The Ring of Benedict, which contains Bendict's soul and is a powerful aid to spirit magic
Harboring the Waldensians around 1250 CE
Secretly coordinating with the British monarchy to overthrow Napoleon
