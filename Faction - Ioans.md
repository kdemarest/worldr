## Ioans Today

There are still living Ioans, kept immortal within their metal suits. An Ioan religio-fascist sect, corrupted, set up death camps and killed their Ioan opponents and the spirits were captured by the Corruptor. So only the Ioan Fascists remain, now trapped immortal in their suits of armor.

## Ioan History

1. Corruptor makes contact with selected Ioans, astroturfing the secretive "Ishaku" based on their pre-disposition to power and fascism. It is a cult of getting slaves to do all the work.  
2. Corruptor gives the Ioans golem tech, making them very happy, but puts it under the control of the Ishaku cult. Nobody else knows the golems require souls.   
3. Fascism evolves because that utilizes golems most effectively, and the treatment of the golems spills over into the same treatment for the non-elites classes.  
4. Ioan society becomes rather dependant on golems.  
5. Eventually a fascist leader learns souls are required, but it is too late.  
6. At this time, for those willing to know the truth, it becomes clear that anyone corrupted can't reproduce biologically, thus creating no new spirits.  
7. The fascist leaders begin essentially a breeding/enslavement/conversion program where the proletariat are grown just past breeding age, and then harvested for golem spirits. They do this somewhat reluctantly until the Corruptor gives them immortality suits, which are the robotic exteriors you see now.  
8. An anti-fascist realizes that everyone is being shackled into golems. He kills all the remaining Ioan proles and himself.  
9. The Corruptor, having no more use for the Ioans, brings the elites to Jupiter as middle management slaves. The Moa begin to dwindle.
