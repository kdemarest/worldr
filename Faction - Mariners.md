Just as the Goliath Crabs create a competitive environment that keeps the Zocto from civlizing, so the Corruptor would like to inflict this on humanity. 

Maybe soul weave does in fact require a spirit+ether. So Henton's spirits must be used.

It is invasion of the body snatchers. Maybe humans become "meat golems"

**Do all corrupted enslaved races lose the ability to reproduce? Unable to create new souls. So you give birth in some case, but they are all stillborn because no soul.**

Moa are merely the corruptor's favored golem shape. Easy to make, large and strong. Always filled with shackled spirits. Ioans, when they were overthrown, many spirits were shackled into Moai. Not so with the Zocto \- the Corruptor was unable to capture their spirits.

So now most Moa on Jupiter have the spirits of dead Ioans.
