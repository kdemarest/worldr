# Faction: The Benedictines

Historically, the Benedictine monks of Europe (aka the Black Monks for their robes) were part of a heroic cast that saw the problem, came together, built and warded monasteries, and slowly worked to rid Europe of the menace, succeeding in a few places. Britain is one, a rare place where the formal leadership as well as the monks can operate in tandem to oppose the Corruptor.

Saint Benedict of Nursia (?-547CE) founded the order, when Italy was first becoming overthrown, around CE500. He escaped numerous poisonings, sometimes attempted by monks (all true).

Benedict created a "parallel" organization, called the Veritas Benedictus, Benedictine Truth, or Veritasium in common conversation.

The formal leadership, typically all corrupted if their region is also generally corrupted, amasses wealth for the Christain church and the corruptor's minions. In parallel, a shadow organization exists.

This organization, known as the Benedictine Truth (or BT if you have to mention it in writing or words), is the Illuminati of human resistance to the Corruptor in Europe and the Empire.

Late in his life, Benedict recognized a certain British general as key. The earliest reference to Arthur is in a poem dating from around AD 594. Aneirin’s "Y Gododdin" is the earliest surviving Welsh poem and consists of a series of separate elegies to the men of the Gododdin who died at the Battle of Catraeth. This was Arthur attempting to oppose an Overthrown local. It is the inception of a history of "lessons learned" for the BTs.

One such lesson is that a corrupted ruler causes great harm, and that eventually there will always be corruption. Alfred the Great, Anglo-Saxon king in 871, assembled a law code (the Doom Book) which he grounded on biblical commandments. His attempt laid groundwork for stabilizing the monarchy even if, as often happened, a king or noble became corrupted.

There are nineteen Benedictine Congregations.

The world sees this:  
"Despite being called an order, the Benedictines do not operate under a single hierarchy but are instead organised as a collection of autonomous monasteries; they do not have a superior general or motherhouse with universal jurisdiction."

## Veritas Benedictum

Spearheaded by a council called the Consilium Vero, here are the ranks within the BTs:

1. **Instruments** - the worldly people that serve the interests of the adherents. Typically kept ignorant, some Instruments are allowed into the some of the deeper secrets, if they prove themselves.  
2. **Adherents** - the monks themselves, who organize and are the core of cells, like a resistance movement.  
3. **Initiate** - a cell leader, typically knowledgeable in the secrets  
4. **Counselor** - a member of the Consilium Vero.

After special screening, people are chosen to whom the corruptor is blind, and who are willing to die if discovered. They live by the Rule of Saint Benedict, which enhances this blindness, and are trained in Secret Illuminations: various methods of detection, resistance, and so on. They are also extremely competent and capable people, studying politics, leadership, warfare, geography, psychology and methods of sublime influence in the isolation of their cells.

## Mission

The overall mission is to free humanity from the ever-spreading Corruptor.

Much of Europe is still shackled, but Benedictine Truth leaders have determined that, by freeing other less populous cultures and gathering the shards of their Black Relics, the corruptor can be weakened.

### Vulnerable Characteristics:

* Thinking you are above others  
* Displaying cruelty to others  
* Killing without reason  
* Socially irresponsible behavior  
* Disregarding or violating the natural rights of others  
* Inability to distinguish between right and wrong  
* Difficulty with showing remorse or empathy  
* Tendency to lie often  
* Manipulating and hurting others  
* Recurring problems with the law  
* General disregard towards safety and responsibility  

## Consilium Vero (Benedictine Council)

A council composed of Esente (ez-en-teh), meaning free or at liberty, guides the efforts of the Benedictines. It is composed of:

* The Italian Abbott Edouardo, a disguised Prince Regent George VI  
* Maria Fitzherbert  
* Talleyrand - Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-Périgord - Foreign minister of France under many rulers, and prime mover of barring slavery at the Congress of Vienna  
* Thomas Young - the last man who knew everything, who translated the rosetta stone  
* Richard Arkwright - genius inventor, now repentant of the suffering his inventions have caused.  
* Florence Nightingale - founder of modern nursing  
* Johann Goethe - author of Faust, a mighty German thinker  

The Council harbors in a gold-lined room cut into Mont Blanc in the Swiss Alps.

## Vows

Benedictines take vows of:

* **Obedience** (to god)  
* **Stability** (supporting and never leaving others in the order)  
* **Conversatio Morum** (conversion of their entire life purpose to serve the holy order)

These vows take on a special meaning when you are a BT, instead of a leader in the order:

* Obedience means to god, but also a military type obedience to BT leaders  
* Stability extends to killing them and boxing the dead.  
* Conversatio Morum means willingly sacrificing your life to save humanity  

## Benedictine Secrets

The simple truth is that the Benedictines know relatively little about the Corruptor, and need to learn more. Their secrets are a mixture of knowledge, techniques, and identifying communication.

Benedictine monk robes are not actually a uniform black. If you look at certain areas of the robe in angled light, and you know what to look for, a difference in texture of the robe will reflect and show you the hierarchy badge of the monk, indicating their role in the BTs. Non-BTs get these as well, in case they are ever discovered, but all BTs know the indicator of non-BT status.

## During the Napoleonic Wars

The Benedictines were actually running the surveillance efforts of the Alien Office, while the Alien Office thought it reported to the King's Government. Everyone knows there is a relationship, but nobody seems to know what.

## Benedictine Presence

All of their abbeys, and many other locations besides, have secret compartments that are either lined with lead, or contain a movable lead box. The lead isn't thick enough to keep the Corruptor out forever, but it isolates a person or body long enough that they can be moved or, if dead, fully destroyed before they reveal the Benedictine Truth.

## Important BT Locations

Ebstorf Abbey  
Westminster Abbey  
Minos Island  
Nursus  
Geneva  

## Benedict's Truth

Saint Benedict is the patron saint of all Europe and of exorcists. The St. Benedict medal is displayed on the homepage of the International Catholic Association Of Exorcists.

Lucius continues his painstaking decoding of the cypher book given to him by his abbot. It is the secret writing of Saint Benedict of Nursia, creator of the codes of conduct used in monastic orders for centuries.

Lucius' memorization of the signals by which members of the inner circle of the Benedictines may recognize each other was completed in a single night.

Now, new truths begin to unfold. Benedict speaks of god and satan. He speaks of angels and devils. He speaks about exorcizing demons that have lodged in the flesh of mortals. Then he begins to speak of the types of demons. It is clear that there are two kinds.

The first kind are familiar: the victim is possessed and suffers seizures, or disease, or compulsions of the mind. Priests attempting to evict this type of demon come to no harm.

The second kind is more terrible. In addition to the symptoms above, physical manifestations exhibit beyond the body of the victim. These might include minor levitations, strange lights, reverting to a more primitive state, or poisoning the minds of others. Paranoid raving is a hallmark of such possessions. The holy and most blessed exorcist often dies in the attempt, and even when successful, often suffers extreme bad luck amounting to a curse. Those who succeed often seem subtly changed, never for the better.

Possessions of the Second Kind, as he calls them, are the central subject of this encrypted book.
