# Faction: The Corrupt

## The Corruptor
Treating people like objects and enslaving them weakens men against the Corruptor.

To keep humanity strong the prince Regent and Lord Castlereagh through the efforts at the Vienna Congress and the West Africa patrol are trying to weaken one God and create another.

The player characters will be the ones who ultimately create the god

Thoth is an ancient Egyptian deity. In art, he was often depicted as a man with the head of an ibis or a baboon, animals sacred to him. His feminine counterpart was Seshat, and his wife was Ma'at. He was the god of wisdom, writing, hieroglyphs, science, magic, art, judgment, and the dead. His Greek equivalent is Hermes, ie the Hermetic arts.

Called by the Sumerians Enlil or sometimes Luugil.

The Zocto word is not describable, but the Corruptor while on Jupiter often takes the form of a giant abominable Zocto, which somewhat resembles Cthulhu.

The core nature of the corruptor is:
* It is a paranoid, intent on destroying all sentients, whom it fears will inevitably destroy it
* It is a psychopath, barely able to stop from killing every sentient it overthrows
* It greedily gathers minds (or souls if you like) by overthrowing sentient minds
* It spreads gradually around the globe through "seed" psychopaths transmitting to others
* It enables some to bring "chaos beings" onto the planet to aid its work
* Shackled Spirits are the primary means of its action upon the material world.
* Lies and astroturfing anti-sentient organizations is also a major tactic
* It both uses and resists technology. Its long-term view is that tech will always destroy a civilization. 
* Overthrown people
   * A sentient taking godlike power over others, or psychopathy, attracts overthrow, but other can be overthrown by force
   * Such people and groups look normal, but are amoral and soulless
   * Longer or deeper corruption makes your bones black in a process called Nerossis (black+bone).
   * Overthrown may be killed (and turned to dark spirits), animalized, or reverted to a primitive baboon-like state.
* Seven "Wards" are manifest. See below.

## Motivation
The Corruptor is an amoral paranoid psychopath. It is certain that, if other sentients knew of its existence and power, they would fear it, band together, and seek to destroy it. Thus, all sentients must be controlled, enslaved, and destroyed (or "cleansed" in the Corruptor's thinking). It is obvious.

At the same time, it is so deeply afraid that this great, driving fear prompts murderous rage.
* Amoral - cares not what methods it uses, destroying minds, spirits, anything
* Paranoid - kill or be killed
* Psychopath - can barely restrain itself from killing those it overthrows
* Sadist - it delights in causing pain to sentients, for pain's sake

The Corruptor thinks very, very long term and has great patience and guile. It seeks to overcome every sentient mind on the planet, and it will use the minds it has overthrown to further its work.

At the same time, the corruptor is a psychopathic murderer. Despite its guile, it may freak out at any moment and simply kill an overthrown person for no reason.

## Spread
The corruptor is always looking for new ways to spread across the globe, and all of the ways in which it CAN spread are not known for certain.

However, the slave trade is a key element. Even overthrown individuals will not willingly leave their homes in sufficient numbers to spread corruption to other cultures. However, causing corrupted Europeans to trade in slaves accomplishes the needed spread handily. This is one reason the British enacted the ban against the slave trade along the West African coast.

Ashanti captured and traded many slaves, also opening the door to the Corruptor. The Javans were open about opposing the corruptor, bringing on the volcanic eruption to destroy them.

## Plan
The Corruptor is a very long term thinker. He is promoting humanity to destroy itself with technology.

See "Rb - Plot" for details on the various planned apocalypses (aka Cleansings)

### Minions
The ultimate goal of the Corruptor is **BITE**:
* Behavior control
* Information control
* Thought control
* Emotional control

### Wards
When the Corruptor slipped across planes, it came to reside (spiritually) in the eye of Jupiter's earth-sized storm. From there, as it captured the mind of Djoser, it used him and others to generate a series of Wards: alterations to the laws of nature. Here they are

<< Many things are just the laws of the world, for example, that Spirits can be controlled to magical effect, and mal-influenced to bring bad luck.

**8th Ward: Consumption**  
King George is the 8th ward. He is the Avatar of the Madness of Consumption, and his warding power is the social stigma attached to insanity. He is the catalyst that created the inception of US capitalism.

Various Great Men throughout history saw through the Corruptor's scheme and quietly counter-acted, embedding Truth and Secrets in codices using codes the Corruptor could not penetrate. Western religious prophets attempted to propagate teachings that would counteract "opening the door", with limited success.

### Avatars
The corruptor has multiple avatars that mirror his aspects. When each possesses a person there is a different effect.

The avatars are: An Egyptian, Minoan, Chinese (Wucheng), Persian, Indian, Bantu, Olmec, and soon the 8th will be British

1. Submission (the word Islam means Submission), including misplaced loyalty  
2. Falsehood/deception, including making up false reasons for things to satisfy emotion  
3. Ignorance/faith/reality warping - in the sense of never seeking truth when emotion is satisfied; includes a lack of self-knowledge, and a lack of curiosity and no feeling of needing to know reality  
4. Subjugation - Bantu, 4th ward, The Enslavement of both of men and nature, without regard to balance  
5. Hate/disregard/callousness - This avatar is the entry point to most access by the Corruptor into the minds of humans  
6. Misplaced loyalty - only following those who meet your emotional criteria, rather than looking beyond to the good of the whole  
7. TBD 

### Servants
Overthrown – people lost to corruption  
Shill – a good guy who will turn at the worst moment  
Agents – serve an overthrown government  
Reverted – crazy baboon monkey things that once were men  
Black Relic – an artifact the is the dark heart of a corrupted community  
Skin Dancer – the skin of a man, removed, animated with his corrupted spirit  
Wax man – look human. Not.  
Golems – statues brought to life can be any size  
Odalisque – a harem girl or boy with charming powers  
Pawn – otherwise regular humans leading everyday lives  
Thrall – DETAILS  
Trancer – DETAILS  
Shaman – DETAILS, conjures curses and dark magics most subtle  
Avatar – an direct manifestation of an aspect of the corruptor itself

## Overthrow
Overthrow is the phenomenon where the mind of a sentient being is invaded and put into the service of the Corruptor.

## The Overthrown
Sentients overthrown can not think clearly. They are wantonly cruel, and lack all empathy. They are only happy because their eyes are blinded to the suffering they cause, and they will parrot the lies of the corruptor when questioned. Serving the self becomes paramount, though normally this does not override the conditioning of culture and civility. However, they are not idiots. They still live normal-looking lives, and seek to hide their status from others.

The intellect of overthrown individuals can not advance into the modern age. Math, reasoning, measuring risk, and empathy are impossible for them. They are cruel, low, conniving, rule-breaking, unintelligent, ruthless savages. They mate only to propagate the species. Nobody is kind, or thoughtful.

For example, a hungry child steals food. A tribal elder hacks off his hand, and nobody thinks anything of it. Opposing tribes are captured and enslaved.

Visiting a group that is under the corruptor's influence does not look immediately odd. People go about their regular lives, hunting, fishing, laughing and arguing. Only by careful interaction and testing can differences be detected.

## The Shackle
The Overthrown always exhibit some form of Shackle, which is not necessary to begin overthrow but gradually becomes necessary to maintain it. The form of enshacklement varies by the culture:
* A creature under the skin at the back of the neck
* Body snatchers style replacements, powered by the brains of the actual people
* Tattoos symbolizing connection to the corruptor
* Missing teeth, kept hidden and surrounded by enchantment
* Sometimes a charismatic leader speaks with regularity
* A common drink, like coffee/tea is in western culture

The players will get a cautionary tale that, another group like them, now dead, once took direct action to unshackle a tribe, and the corruptor killed every single member of the tribe outright. So you can't just kill the leaders, or let them know you are trying to find the black relic. It is a subtle business of hiding and accessing the Tombs to perform the unshackling.

## Control
Direct control is most easily conducted through the Shackle (disadvantage on rolls), but can be achieved in a newly overthrown mind (advantage on rolls).

The Corruptor has the power over those it controls:
* Convert them from pawn to thrall, trancer or shaman
* Kill them outright, after a full week of control

Control of a society is often evinced through a chief and/or shaman, who acts as a lynch pin to keep the society under domination, but even this is passive control. When actively inhabited by the Corruptor one gains strange powers and corrupt characteristics, like deformities, movement becomes jerky, acting as puppets. See the Pawn, Thrall, Trancer and Shaman for details.

In addition, sometimes societal control must be reinforced. Tribal rituals, trance dances, certain drugs, etc can have an influence.

Superstition is also important. Every tribe's "shackles" are different, usually aligning with the Avatar that controls them, and the weaknesses that might free a tribe are also different. Adherence to superstition usually exists because that would introduce a weakness.

## Resistance
Nobody is entirely certain why some people can resist overthrow, but the following is known:
* Some people simply can not be perceived by the corruptor, like Saint Benedict
* Women are harder to inhabit, gaining them worse treatment in many societies
* Children must grow to a certain age before becoming controlled. Thus the ceremonies of entry into adulthood prevalent in so many tribes exist.

## Outsiders
Many overthrown tribes have hermits or "madmen" that are outside the regime, and although they may not realize exactly what is wrong, they know that something is and are trying to isolate themselves, or escape it or rectify it. Such people can frequently help the PCs identify the problem, and where to go next. Sometimes, an adjacent tribe or a rebel group will exist, giving aid, or providing a guide, providing troops, expertise, or creating a distraction to aid the PCs.

## Unshackling Individuals
If you wish to unshackle a single individual, you risk killing them but it can be done. One path is through exorcism. A strong shared belief in a deity, held by 13 people nearby, can drive out the influence and free the person, but they will be again at risk after.

Another method is to use certain metals. A thick layer of lead or a thin layer of gold may guard, and thus the golden innermost coffin of Tutankamen.

## Unshackling Villages
Unshackling an entire village/culture means destroying their Black Relic, to be found in its most holy and difficult-to-reach places, guarded by wards, traps and denizens. It can not simply be buried, as the veneration and fear of the place it is kept is important to the enslavement of the tribe.

* Traps: The traps in those places can only be created by the savages, so are primitive, but are mixed with the supernatural magic and influence of the corruptor.
* Black Relic: Usually within the skull of an ancestor leader, who in addition may be animated in skeletal madness
* Where: buried in an ornate tomb, a cliff-side shrine, through a dangerous jungle voyage, or sunk to the bottom of a sinister lake. Sometimes distributed among a few places.

Unshackling an culture creates a momentary weakness, allowing the PCs to overcome curses that have been placed upon them or others (the Corruptor will suffer massive minuses to rolls).

<<Maybe when colonials come in, their lack of reverence and their corruption weaken a tribe's ancient holy place. The old gods are evicted, and the corruptor takes hold of the holy placea tribe.>>

Smallpox isn't killing the tribes. It is the corruptor not wanting to lose control.

## Obscura
An Obscura is an entity invisible to the Corruptor's perception. Whatever your level, that level requires 3 permanently consumed Int to continue being obscured, and the level below becomes always-on.

1. Your movements in the world are not seen  
2. Your movements among the overthrown are unseen  
3. Your use of magic goes unnoticed  
4. Your movements near BRs go unseen  
5. You are utterly non-existent to corruptor perception  
6. Same as 4 but passive by permanently activating 3 Int pool.

## Power of the Corruptor
When a shackled person perishes, the Corruptor collects their soul. The souls are used to power curses, golems and more.

Don't think of it like a person controlling puppets. Instead, it is more like a highly distributed mind mixed with a force of nature. It does what it does, and cares not for deaths.

At the same time, it can partially see the future. It is excellent at plots and scheming, corrupting or tricking people to serve its interests. Its actions often seem mad, yet contain an insidious effectiveness.

The ultimate purpose of the Corruptor is to collect every human soul. Thus it wants reproduction and an entire planet covered with sentients it controls (a farm planet), OR to destroy every sentient due to paranoia.

## Terminology
**Overthrow** - taking over a mind, whose body becomes a Vessel  
**Vessel** - the body of an overthrown person  
**Avatar** - a vessel inhabited by the corruptor made manifest  
**Obscura** - an entity invisible, to some degree, to the corruptor's perception. 

## Secrets
To some extent everything about the corruptor and the BTs is a secret, but here are some things for the players to unravel:

### Mechanics
* Causes: Psychopathology, murder, callous disregard of mercy, or wielding godlike power over others attracts overthrow
* Created by humans, but Jupiter is its sigil and home; The eye in particular
* You can create a new god. That god can bring you to Jupiter, and guide you in destruction of the corruptor.
* You can shunt a planetoid to disrupt the red eye 
* Resistance: 1% of people may be Resistant to Overthrow
* Obscura: A select few, called the Obscura, can make themselves utterly invisible to the corruptor
* Blacker skeletal bones mean you have been overthrown a long time. Obsidian or black opal level black means you have been under direct control.

### Symptoms
* Indifference to suffering and deaths, and a proclivity to over-punish are symptoms
* Victims killed by the corruptor, or in the process of being majorly overthrown, tend to lie on their backs and cross their arms. This explains egyptian pharaoh caskets, and many christian royal burials (though some is just mimicry)
* Being overthrown causes all your past to become unimportant. Various British explorers who "went native" actually were overthrown by the corruptor

### Defenses
* Lead and gold shield one from the effects of the corruptor. Osmium, iridium, platinum, neptunium and plutonium also all hinder control.
* The gold or silver coin in the mouth, called an Obol, comes from Resistance attempts to prevent the corruptor from gaining the mind of the deceased. The Greeks (ostensibly to pay Charon to cross Styx), and subsequently most of Europe and the middle east saw the practice, but was also a ritual of the Khmer resistance.
* Bright or focused sunlight dampens the corruptor's power

### Magery
* Spirit basis
* Characteristics
* Capabilities
* Substances
* Writing

### Institutional Secrets
* Saint Benedict was tier 6 Obscura, and could thus study the Corruptor's ways
* Benedicting monks actually have two layers - the Front (corrupted) and the Benedictine Truth (the resistance)
* Benedictines have a breeding program, of which Gahan and his father are a part, to create more people who are Obscura.
* The powers of the Thrall, Trancer, Shaman, and Avatar
* Existence and membership of the BT High Council

### Historical Context
* Most of Europe is overthrown - every slaving country
* Napoleon knew, and warred to free Europe. His failure directly lead to the player's expeditions
* Josephine was overthrown, and then Napoleon in his madness.
* George III was overthrown, and while still sane worked against Napoleon. But he deteriorated as the Corruptor converted him towards becoming an Avatar. By the time Napoleon was overthrown, George IV was in nominal control, and now they were opposed for opposite reasons.
* George IV is working with the BTs, not a diletante at all.

### Party Secrets
* The ship has wards in place, especially the figurehead
* Bean works for the BTs, as does Mr. Mump
* Bean's nature
* Mump's nature
* Giselle and Marie Elise, both Obscura, were hired by Bean to breed with Gahan to produce more Obscura
* Constance's gun killed the French courtesan Elise, whose spirit now inhabits it

### Explaining Real History with Insidious Narrative:
* Hermits and rebels have always existed. Now we know why.
* Many ruthless rulers have styled themselves god-kings. They weren't wrong.
* The Vatican is a spreader
* King tut's innermost coffin was pure gold to shield him from overthrow after death; the same had been used earlier in his life to free him
* Labor on the Pacific Island plantations of sugarcane, cotton, coffee was usually slave and often blackbirded
* The founding of the illuminati was actually a leak from the benedictine organization. Weishaupt had to be replaced with a simulacrum.
* When you find kings or popes or whatever in their caskets with their arms crossed, it might be because that is how people position themselves before the corruptor kills them.
* Coins in the mouth after death, to resist overthrow
