# **\!Faction: Cult of Purity**

The offspring of Corruptor astroturfing, this cult worships "the Lord Most Sublime" and the eternal truth that mankind is beyond redemption and must thus go extinct. They serve the Corruptor by helping enact it's long term plans for the "cleansing" of humanity.

They embrace any means to achieve this end, "for the good of all", so even a genocide of cruel deaths is but a coin tosssed into the well of necessity.

Likely an offshoot of gnostic beliefs, but perverted as an inversion: the supreme hidden god is perfection, and only by following the malevolent lesser diety can the hidden god be reached and revealed.

Gnostic [cosmogony](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmogony) generally presents a distinction between a supreme, hidden [God](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/God) and a malevolent [lesser divinity](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demiurge) who is responsible for creating the [material universe](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature). Consequently, Gnostics considered material existence flawed or evil, and held the principal element of [salvation](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvation) to be direct knowledge of the hidden divinity, attained via mystical or [esoteric](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esoteric) insight. Many Gnostic texts deal not in concepts of [sin](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sin) and [repentance](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repentance), but with [illusion](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illusion) and [enlightenment](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divine_illumination).[\[2\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gnosticism#cite_note-FOOTNOTEPagels1989xx-2)
