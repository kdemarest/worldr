# Faction - Witches

Witches strive against corruption with good intentions and dark magic. Philosophically, they want corrupt secrets to be revealed so that humanity can resist. But they have paid a heavy price for this. Now they keep a low profile. Yet they will act when they feel they must, even at risk to their own lives.

Witches are a sparse, world wide affiliation of completely independent women, all of whom are aware of the Corruptor, but all of whom, if they were to use their power openly, would be slain by their own community.

Witches use a kind of sympathy and brewery magic. Following tradition, most witch magic plays on emotions, and utilizes household items common around the world, such as needles and brooms.

## Overview

Witches, under many names, have existed since the time of the Pharoahs. The NPC Moira O'Connor has lived since the time of Saint Benedict (500 AD), before he was a saint.

Interacting with a witch often means making a bargain. At the time the bargain seems good, but with a bit of time a bad taste will develop. It never feels like you are getting quite what you thought from the agreement.

Male witches, called Warlocks, existed briefly in the 1100's, but male aggression lead to many deaths, so now the witches generally forbid men.

## Secrets

* Witches take on a single Black Mark, intentionally, so as to tap into darker powers. Some fall down the slippery slope to corruption, acquiring ever more Black Marks until they are Overthrown.

* Witches may live indefinitely, at a price.

* Witches die, intentionally, from time to time. Using a special hex, they can determine which woman will re-birth them. Over time they (imperfectly) regain their powers and knowledge.

* Witches change countries regularly to avoid suspicion, since even their re-born face often looks like their original.

* Witches usually purge Warlocks when they find them, fearing the repercussions they saw in the Waldensian era.

## History

In antiquity Witches had many names. Heka in Pharaonic Egypt, Malefica in the Roman Empire, and so on. Only relatively recently has the word "Witch" arisen.

## Waldensian to Witch

Around 1170 a particularly powerful witch, Jasmina of Lyon, fell in love with a charismatic and idealistic young man named Pierre de Vaux (Peter Waldo when Anglicized). His passion for bringing truth to the masses inspired her, and she shared the Witch Canon with him. He, in turn, began a social movement that still exists to this day.

Under Peter Waldo, the Waldensians embraced the ethic of sharing the truth about the Corruptor and, as they saw it, about God. They translated the bible, at the time restricted to Latin only, into local languages, with hidden but interpretable messages that would reveal certain Corrupt Truths to a careful listener.

To spread their message, the Waldensians used wandering preachers called "Uncles" (most of whom were also Warlocks), who brought the message by foot to every corner of Europe. Numerous commoners, hearing the word of god in their own languages, became Waldensian followers.

However, the corrupted church soon realized what was happening. Stating that such preaching was "unauthorized", the church ordered the Waldensians to stop. When they refused, the Council of Verona branded them heretics, named them "Witches" and slandered the movement.

For three hundred years the Warlock Uncles were hunted and persecuted. Female witches were burned or stoned to death, teaching the witches that allowing men into the dark circle is impossible.

Waldensians survived by retreating into the Alps, enduring centuries of repression. In 1817, the Waldensians are confined to their Alpine valleys in Piedmont. Elsewhere they are marginalized, discriminated against, and mostly vanished. Female witches no longer associate with Waldensians.
