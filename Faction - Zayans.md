FACTION: THE ZAYANS
The Zayans are a rather handsome simian species with magnificent hair. The Zayans did not achieve sentience naturally. Rather, some Zocto who escaped the apocalypse on Europa uplifted the species, which achieved sentience in 2400 BCE.

The Zocto, aware that the Corruptor was ever vigilant, used Spirit techniques to hide the singular Zayan city of Zanadoo, which was established in 2200 bce. It is located in the impenetrable jungles of the Gold Coast region of Africa, where it would be most difficult for the Orca to detect. 

Secretly guided by the Zocto, the Zayans achieved great knowledge of both material and spiritual matters, which they embodied in thick tablets of a mica-like substance.

As masters of a futuristic steam punk style technology, in 1400 BCE the Zayans gazed into the heavens and saw the great red spot on Jupiter. By this method the Corruptor discovered them. It lead them to devise highly capable robot servants. Two hundred years later, when the time was right, the Corruptor issued an order. The robots overthrew the Zayans, brought the city to ruins, and killed their masters.

Our players will visit Zanadoo, discovering the tablets, the observatory, and a cellar where killer robots still reside amidst skulls of the Zayans. They will also discover the Zocto "aquarium" from which the Zocto covertly uplifted the Zayans.
