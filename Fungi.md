# Fungi
- Wood Ear LINK — these flex a bit on their tree to follow nearby speech or movement. If you eat one whole you can hear what it heard within 20 minutes.
- Curvularia LINK — Black mold fungus. A heat symbiote, smearing it on you and letting it root in skin (takes about an hour) confers heat resistance to about 900 degrees.
- Phaseolina fungus LINK — little goopy black balls. Once on you it travels to your food, covers it and spoils it. Also consumes human hair, making it patchy and gross looking. Will cover eyes, but can be washed out.
- Mushroom Termitomyces Titanicus LINK — Enormous mushroom farmed by termites, sprouts from termite mound. Termites will eat all your wood objects.
- Mushroom Termitomyces Reticulatus LINK — Also farmed by termites, makes a delicious Tomak gravy that restores all pools.
