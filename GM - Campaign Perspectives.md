# Campaign Flavor

## Mysteries Abound
Try to have at least five unresolved mysteries in flight at a time. You might even consider writing them down, so that, from time to time, you can reinforce to the players that they exist.

## Horror is Rare but Punchy
True horror arises infrequently - perhaps every third play session. When it does, it is usually extreme body horror or war-crime style violations of morality. The players shouldn't have to role-play being horrified. They should BE horrified.

## Nobody Understands All Corrupt Secrets
Don't over-play how much any faction actually knows. Most know about 5% of the truth, and even if you were to combine every single thing they knew you might get to 20% total.

## Keep the world ordinary
The constrast between the ordinary and the extra-ordinary relies on the fact that, most of the time, the players are in the ordinary world and that they, themselves, remain vulnerable to ordinary failings - e.g. weapons hurt, falling hurts, darkness matters.

# Player Character Limitations

## Keep Critical Limits
Do not let the players' abilities creep too far into the realm of superheroics.

### Class A Limits
Most player characters should have these limits:
- Unable to seeing anything without a light source
- Falls from a height always do damage
- Hit by mundane weapon always hurt
- Unable to decipher encrypted or alien text
- Unable to detect magically hidden creatures or things
- Remote viewing of contemporaneous events
- Mind control

Abilities that evercome a Class A limit:
- Held by only ONE player in the party
- Are 'expensive' in one or more ways:
	- Consume a scarce resource
	- Are on a timer
	- Require start-up and/or shut-down time
	- Require dedicated effort - no walking around and doing other things

### Class B Limits
No player should be allowed:
	- Flying
	- Teleportation
	- Divination of future events

Generally, flight comes from vehicles or being carried by NPCs using their own free will. Teleportation comes from fixed installations. Both are extremely mysterious, cost resources, and are prone to failure.

Divination is reserved to certain NPCs to move the plot forward.
