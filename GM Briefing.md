# GM Briefing - Behind the Veil

> SPOILER ALERT

The Fermi Paradox asks the question **"Why don't we see other galactic civilizations?"**

In *Rule Brittania*, the answer is the **"Dark Forest"** option: A ruthless galactic species (the Purifex) has sent asteroids with powerful, paranoid beings to all ends of the galaxy. One such landed on Jupiter a mere two million years ago and became Jupiter's Great Red Spot. That being **"The Corruptor."**

In this universe spirits are real, and mediate all supernatural magic. There are **light spirits** helpful to mankind, and **dark spirits** shackled to evil entities that unleash gothic horror upon the mind and body. Sentient beings each harbor a nexus of bright spirit. Beastly species share broad, generalized spiritual essences.

The Corruptor is overwhelmingly powerful in spirit powers, setting seven magical Wards to guard against the rise of sentience. Already it has destroyed the Mariners, Venusians, Ioans, Moai, Zayans and Zocto.

When the bright, sharp spirits of *Homo Sapiens* arose, the Corruptor took notice.

Humanity invented writing in **3500 BC**, a *yellow flag.*  
In **2500 BC** the first Egyptian pharaohs considered themselves gods, a *red flag.* Armed with dark spiritual energies, the Corruptor ignores fragile technologies. It is subtle, and patient.

Over the next **4,500 years** it laid the seeds of humanity's self-destruction, so-called **"Cleansings"**, both quick (asteroids, disease, mega-flooding) and slow (climate change, breeding for non-sentience, nuclear apocalypse).

From the enslaved Ioans, to the human **Cult of Purity**, to the mind and body-warping Wards, the Corruptor wields many tools.

The First Ward causes Anyone hearing the truth about the Corruptor suffers bad luck so extreme that they may not live to see the morning. The second warped humans to become more easily corruptible. The fifth inclines humans to subjugate eachother. And so on.

In **1817**, when our story opens, a new ward in being created, and six Cleansings are already in the works. The Corruptor has infiltrated nearly every savage nation, nearly every religion. Many nations of Europe are also corrupted. **Napoleon**, who warred for 24 years as a secretly enlightened instrument _against_ corruption, has been overthrown and exiled. Now, at the end of the war, the corrupted **Congress of Vienna** has restored European monarchy, a governmental form most prone to corruption.

But Britian stands apart. Yes, the king is mad and fully corrupted. But key individuals in the aristocracy, military, religious orders, the espionage-laced "alien office", and the sciences are clandestinely identifying and working against corruption. Key parts of this illuminati (literally 'the enlightened') are the king's heir George IV, members of the Benedictines called the Veritasium, the Duke of Wellington, geniuses such as Thomas Young and others.

Our players, loyal citizens of the British Empire, unknowingly enter the fray. Guided by these shadowy illuminati, and inheriting the legacy of brilliant minds who have perceived the Corruptor's actions in the past, they are recruited into the struggle to **destroy the Wards** and **fend off the doom of humanity.**

Along the way players must overcome gothic horrors of **body violation, mental manipulation, hallucination and madness**. Even their very souls will be in peril.

Along the way they will uncover sinister secrets, discover lost civilizations and the ultra-tech that drove them, venture to the center of the earth, and even travel to other planets.

While every campaign is different, some possible outcomes include  **setting Jupiter alight as a second sun**, or **creating a new god** to face the Corruptor with all the spiritual power of humanity and remaining sentient species.
