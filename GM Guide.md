# **Overview of Play**

**GM's Eyes Only**

**Our heroes are diverse members of the British Empire saving humanity from an ancient evil.** Along the way, they will learn the secrets of magic, defeat a possessed Napoleon Bonaparte, defend humanity against extinction, create a new god, and guide a moon to destroy the red spot on Jupiter.

Set in 1817 Regency England, the players do their duty for the glory of the empire, with roles such as British Navy, Doctor, Foreign Office Spy, Street Urchin, Benedictine Monk, 

Given a small ship by powerful yet shadowy illuminati, their charter is to travel the globe freeing tribes from the insidious influence of the Corruptor. The Corruptor has overthrown the minds of nearly all primitive tribes, causing the Anchor of its influence to be secreted and inaccessible. Our heroes seek those Anchors, to weaken the Corruptor's influence and eventually free Europe.

# **Faction: Britain (The United Kingdom)**

Britain has escaped this fate (as far as we know) and its conquest of the world is driven by the Benedictine Council. See the Benedictine Council.

Why is the British empire so strangely scattered around seemingly random countries? Those are determined to be most likely locations of key Black Relics. 

As each country is unshackled, an independence movement will be seeded, and it will gradually be released from the empire.

**Gnostics**: Gnosticism presents a distinction between the highest, unknowable God, and the demiurge “creator” of the material universe. The Gnostics considered the most essential part of the process of salvation to be this personal knowledge, in contrast to faith as an outlook in their world view along with faith in the ecclesiastical authority. They were regarded as heretics by the Fathers of the early church.

**Hermetics**: Hermeticism seeks a primeval, divine wisdom, revealed only to the most ancient of sages, such as Hermes Trismegistus. In the Renaissance, this developed into the notion of a prisca theologia or "ancient theology", which asserted that there is a single, true theology which was given by God to some of the first humans, and traces of which may still be found in various ancient systems of thought. Thinkers like Giovanni Pico della Mirandola (1463–1494) supposed that this 'ancient theology' could be reconstructed by studying the most ancient writings still in existence, such as those of Hermes, Zoroaster, Orpheus, Pythagoras, Plato, the 'Chaldeans', or the Kaballah.

Moral Questions

* A higher station person refuses to acknowledge a lower station person  
* A person uses a simulacrum of their father as a demeaned slave  
* A dog chews apart some shoes, and is killed for it; or a small chick is feeding in a yard and a man steps on it for no reason.  
* A baker refuses to bake a cake with a pro-slavery message  
* An underling asserts some kind of equality, and is punished

Campaign Customization

* Consider: giving players 3 chits per day that enable them to "take 10" on any Task requiring a roll of 10 or less.  
* Consider: Half way through the night, players must roll 50% chance to lose all pool points above 50% of their starting value.  
* Ability: Citizen of Empire \- as a British citizen, you can use the power of the British Empire, the Pax Britannia, implied military might and so on in social interactions  
* Disad: Cultural Hubris \- Knowing for certain that British culture is superior, you often miss opportunities to "take the good parts" of other cultures. You are hide-bound, and like Robert Falcon Scott, ignore reality in favor of British is Best.
