# SUMMARY

The world of RB is an alternate earth in the year 1817, where:  
\* spirits and magic are real  
\* the insane Corruptor manipulates the course of humanity towards extinction  
\* secret organizations strive to avert that cataclysm

History is exactly the same as Earth, except that behind the scenes it has always been driven by humanity's resistance to the Corruptor. The rise and fall of empires, lives of famous people, even seeming natural events like volcanic eruptions are sometimes actually the result of mysterious forces.

Key themes of the game include:

* Alt World \- It is the real world of 1817, but supernatural magic and horror elements hide below the surface. The players actions will cause history to diverge.  
* Spirits \- are real, and can be engaged. They are the source of all magical activity.  
* Nobody Knows \- Normal people never see any spirits, nor the actions of the Corruptor. When they do see there is always an explanation.  
* Gothic Horror \- evil corrupts hearts, souls, and bodies, twisting them against the laws of nature. In a world that seems normal, learning too much means exposure to horrors.  
* Secrets \- Misfortune and death take all who speak the forbidden knowledge of the evil Corruptor.  
* Subtlety \- The forces of evil are subtle, long planning, and will   
* Pride in the British Empire \- Faith by the player characters that the empire is the pinnacle of human achievement. Not to mention the importance of tea time.  
* Discovery \- The players start out knowing NONE of this. Through adventure many mysteries will arise, and just enough answered to propel enjoyable play. 

Key Elements

* British Empire \-   
* Corruptor \- An insane, clandestine enemy working towards the extinction or enslavement of humanity.  
* Secret Organizations \- like the European Illuminati, the Benedictines, Witches Coven, and alien Zocto work clandestinely against the Corruptor

# The Corruptor

An ancient evil named the Corruptor seeks to dominate and enslave or destroy the human race. The Corruptor is embodied on Jupiter as the Red Spot, but its true power lies in the Spirit Realm.

Origin  
An alien civilization called the Purifex used the Corruptor millions of years ago to crush a civilization called the Mariners, whose ruins still lie at the center of the Earth. Now it remains on Jupiter as a sentinel to make sure that no competing sentients arise in the Sol solar system. Such emerging civilizations are detected when they invent writing.

Cleansings  
The Corruptor is insane yet subtle and patient, bent on destroying any detected sentients through slow, steady, guaranteed methods called "Cleansings". The cleansings are:

* Overheating, called Cleansing by Filth; eg climate change  
* Pandemic, called Cleansing by Life; includes genetically modified pandemic sources  
* Torpor, called Cleansing by Futility; AI renders humans purposeless and redundant  
* War, called Cleansing by Fire; includes nuclear or nanotech weapons  
* Asteroid, called Cleansing by Stone; hurled meteors, even (in the past) the moon  
* EcoLapse, called Cleansing by Many; Overpopulation driving consumption, commons abuse, and ecological collapse  
* Invasives, called Cleansing by Competition; An invasive species out-competes humanity

Wards  
The Corruptor has created seven "Wards" that warp humanity, and is in the process of creating an Eighth Ward (King George III).

The most important wards are:

1st Ward: Concealment "Occultare", 2650BC  
Effect: The Corruptor shall be aware when anyone speaks Secrets. Misfortune and death will follow those speaking and those hearing.  
Avatar: Egyptian Pharoah Djoser

2nd Ward: Shaping (Formatura), 2000BC  
Effect: Human minds and genetic code yield more easily to corruption. Both can be warped to alter the character of human kind.  
Avatar: Minoan King Minos

3rd Ward: Selfishness (Deprava), 1300BC  
Effect: Leaders pursue self-interest over species or community interest, willingly leading others towards hate and division  
Avatar: Wucheng Chinese

4th Ward: Tribalism (Tribala), 600 BC  
Effect: Causes all humans to look at the "other" with deep suspicion, easily provoked by leaders. This drives war, genocide, racism, etc. including very subtle programs like Indian Schools. Avatar: Olmec King

5th Ward: Subjugation (Subjugare), 0AD  
Effect: Reduces human qualms against abusively subjugating nature, beasts and other men. Avatar: Bantu King

6th Ward: Ignorance (Inscius), 700AD  
Effect: Causes the human mind to follow emotion (denialism) and the dictates of authority without question (submission), rejecting the quest for inconvenient truths  
Avatar: Persian Cyrus the Great

7th Ward: Gratification, 1400AD  
Effect: All men shall pursue the easy path, embrace ease and ignore the future.  
Avatar: Indian/Mongol ruler Timur

8th Ward: Consumption, circa 1820AD  
Effect: Nationalism and Capitalism lead to an arms race of consumption, destroying the commons and leading to extinction-level environmental collapses.  
Avatar: (in process) British King George III

Overall Effects of the Wards:  
Almost no human knows about the Corruptor, because of the Ward of Concealment and because the Corruptor and its minions act in secret. The Ward of Shaping prepared humanity for warping by later Wards.

Most of humanity passively ignores the peril of actions that lead towards Cleansing. The Wards of Selfishness, Ignorance and Gratification keep them from considering the problems, while the Wards of Tribalism and Subjugation distract them with endless inter-human conflict. When the Ward of Consumption is complete, a death-spiral towards Cleansing will be inevitable.

\======================================

# THE SITUATION

## The Situation in Europe

The game begins in 1817 London. In Europe the Napoleonic wars has just ended and a monarchical peace established.

After Napoleon's first defeat the Congress of Vienna convenes in 1814-1815 with hundreds of representatives. But in truth, a small cabal of five men from Austria, Prussia, Russia, and Great Britain, plus Talleyrand from France, restructure all of Europe.

The British gain acceptance of a ban on slavery, secretly thwarting the will of the Corruptor. A secret group, including George IV and others, works behind the scenes in Britain to save Britain and all Europe from Corruption. Twenty four years prior, they sponsored Napoleon. Three years ago they had to defeat him.

Napoleon discovered the activity of the Corruptor as a young man. He set out to unite all France under egalitarian anti-corruptor ethics and use the tools of Empire to conquer corrupted regimes. But alas he himself was eventually corrupted and mentally overthrown after his true love Josephine was subverted. Now he is exiled, but his secret power is growing unbeknownst to anyone.

## Activity of the Corruptor

In addition to empowering the exiled Napoleon, the Corruptor conducts many activities to bring about a future Cleansing, including:

\* Collaborate with Napoleon in exile, using the Ward of Shaping to turn King George III into the Eighth Ward. The French use portals to gain a toehold on Venus

\* Encouraging the initial eruption of Mt Tambora's, and seeking to bring about a second, much larger eruption. This will put earth into perpetual winter. This project is ongoing.

\* Using the Ward of Subjugation to reignite the African slave trade to the new world through Dutch and Spanish privateers, despite opposition from the British monarchy.

\* Continuing the long-hidden Cult of Purity which believes that humanity is an impure, imperfect failure which must be cleansed from the earth.

\* Enabling and encouraging human technological advancement that depends on energy and resource consumption, and encouraging government forms that require human exploitation.

# SPIRITS AND MAGIC

In RB spirits are real. They come in two forms: Sentient and Natural. Certain gifted humans called Spirit Masters can see, obtain, and manipulate spirits to perform supernatural acts. Spirits can possess sentients, power unnatural golems, haunt place or objects, and serve mages.

The underlying material of all existence, called Ether, makes up a special substance called Spirit Thread that can grant items magical properties.

**BAD LUCK**  
Speaking the secrets of the Corruptor brings about Bad Luck that prompts tragedies or even death. This is why so much must be done in secret to save humanity.

**MAGIC**  
Spirits mediate all supernatural events or magical objects. Magic comes in numerous schools, some good such as Attunism, Companionism, Illuminism, Revelationism, and Spectrism; and some bad such as Cursism, Degenerism, Dominism, Golemism, Mentalism and Realitism.

Advanced players can acquire spiritual defenses against harmful magic.

# PHENOMENA

## Secrets

The Ward of Concealment forbids communicating a wide range of Secrets that are core to the power of the Corruptor, the revelation of which bring Bad Luck. Such secrets include:

* The existence, purposes and core activities of the Corruptor and its minions  
* All knowledge of spirits, spiritual techniques, magic, and magical defenses. One may not prove to somebody that these things exist.  
* The nature of Wards, Cleansings, and Obscura.

## Bad Luck

Bad Luck can be brought on by sharing the Secrets of the Corruptor, or it can be inflicted by a Dark Mage. Arsenic worsens Bad Luck. It can be countered by 

In game terms Bad Luck is expressed as a number from 0 to 20\. Any raw dice roll, for any action, that is equal to or lower than a player's Bad Luck score can result in a Mishap at the GM's discretion.

## Mishaps

A mishap generally does not cause the person with bad luck to suffer a problem, but rather tends to negatively impact others or lead to a negative, sometimes unintended, outcome. For example, a mishap usually isn't "you lost your shoe" but rather it is "Bob loses his shoe indirectly because of your action.

The higher the bad luck, and the lower the roll, the worse the outcome typically is.

When bad luck is high (eg 10 or more) and a 1 is rolled, the mishap can become deadly to nearby NPCs or disabling to player characters.

## Corruption

"Corruption" is to become willfully unaware or in denial of the works of the Corruptor, and the behaviors that are leading humanity towards self-destruction, the so-called Cleansings. Deeper corruption is to serve the Corruptor willingly

## Ooron

This glowing green substance in much like uranium. It powers most Zocto technology, and it can be found in nature and refined.

# SPIRITS

In this world spirits are real. Spirits can neither be created nor destroyed, and all sentient spirits arise from only from the natural process of reproduction. 

Spirits are of two types:

1. **Sentient spirits** (those of humans and a select few animals) exist within living sentients and sometimes linger after death. In game terms, a person has both a "soul" which is unknowable, and a "spirit" which exists ethereally within the world.  
2. **Nature spirits** (of animals and plants) align roughly by species, each having a "master spirit". For example, a single, universal "spirit of foxes" exists for all foxes, and the spirit of brambles exists for all brambles, and so on.

**Sentient Spirits** are found in a few states, some of which serve good or evil mages. Forcing a spirit to evil acts can open a door to the Corruptor and gain the mage a Black Mark.

1. **Spirit Thread** \- composed of primordial ether, spirit thread can be formed and used by the arcane. It can be used to create magical things like portals or rings, and is often seen connecting spiritually connected beings. But no mortal has the capability to form this thread into a new sentient or natural spirit.  
2. **Living** \- Spirits found in living creatures are not typically visible. They are "locked in" to their material body until death. They can sometimes be affected with magic to influence the mind or body.  
3. **Vanishing** \- Upon death a spirit slowly tears away from its mortal coil and drifts to an unknown place. Certain things during this process, the spirit might become tethered, shackled, or kept.  
4. **Haunting** \- Certain deaths leave critical, unresolved problems. In such cases the spirit may remain upon the earth to haunt places or objects in torment, such as haunting the house where they were murdered, or haunting the dagger that unjustly slew them.  
5. **Tethered** \- When a good mage persuades a spirit to join his cause the spirit becomes tethered to that mage. It will stay so long as the mage does not ask it for things against its nature.  
6. **Shackled** \- When an evil mage forces a spirit into his service it is shackled. This is an unnatural act, which always opens a door to the Corruptor. Among other uses shackled spirits can be caused to Possess an sentient, taking control of it's body, or placed within a Blue Vitriol Crystal to power a golem.

**Nature Spirits** are much simpler. They never haunt. They can not be tethered nor shackled. They do not form spirit thread. When they die nothing happens, because the creature's spirit was already part of the master spirit. 

Nature spirits are more pliable when they are alive than sentient spirits. Without sentience to defend their minds nature spirits in the form of a specific plant or animal can be contacted and influenced by a naturalist mage. In addition, just as an animal can take on the traits granted by its master spirit, and naturalist mage can learn ways to take on such traits.

**BLACK MARKS**

A Black mark is a mark against the soul of a person, which leads them towards corruption. When players perform an evil act, such as killing without strict necessity, they feel "a door open". This is the door to the Corruptor.

When a black mark is gained, the player will have a vision of the Corruptor in one of his many forms, appropriate to the situation and the player having the vision. They will be in the vision for a short time, experiencing the menace of the enemy, then snap back to reality and no time has passed.

Corruption is expressed as a Bad Luck number, but the resulting mishaps tend more towards evil than mere mischance. For example, instead of a player accidentally knocking a vial of acid onto Bartholomew, it instead scars his face in such a way that his fiance breaks off the engagement. As with regular mishaps, the magnitude of the evil is proportional to the difference.

\====================================================================

**FACTION: THE ZAYANS**  
The Zayans are a rather handsome simian species with magnificent hair. The Zayans did not achieve sentience naturally. Rather, some Zocto who escaped the apocalypse on Europa uplifted the species, which achieved sentience in 2400 BCE.

The Zocto, aware that the Corruptor was ever vigilant, used Spirit techniques to hide the singular Zayan city of Zanadoo, which was established in 2200 bce. It is located in the impenetrable jungles of the Gold Coast region of Africa, where it would be most difficult for the Orca to detect. 

Secretly guided by the Zocto, the Zayans achieved great knowledge of both material and spiritual matters, which they embodied in thick tablets of a mica-like substance.

As masters of a futuristic steam punk style technology, in 1400 BCE the Zayans gazed into the heavens and saw the great red spot on Jupiter. By this method the Corruptor discovered them. It lead them to devise highly capable robot servants. Two hundred years later, when the time was right, the Corruptor issued an order. The robots overthrew the Zayans, brought the city to ruins, and killed their masters.

Our players will visit Zanadoo, discovering the tablets, the observatory, and a cellar where killer robots still reside amidst skulls of the Zayans. They will also discover the Zocto "aquarium" from which the Zocto covertly uplifted the Zayans.

**FACTION: THE BENEDICTINE TRUTH**

Around 500 CE Benedict of Nursia discovered the activity of the Corruptor. To free himself from all corruption he became a hermit, and when ready, founded the first Benedictine monastery.

He then created a covert organization within the Catholic church to covertly counter the corruption in the papacy, called the Veritas Benedictum or simply the Veritasium. This covert organization hides in plain sight, operating among the lower echelons of Benedictine monks.

For over a thousand years it has sought to counter the Corruptor in Europe. Achievements include:

* The Ring of Benedict, which contains Bendict's soul and is a powerful aid to spirit magic  
* Harboring the Waldensians around 1250 CE  
* Secretly coordinating with the British monarchy to overthrow Napoleon

**FACTION: WITCHES**

Formerly a group called the Waldensians, dedicated to resisting the effects of the Corruptor, the witches have dwindled and have been so completely discredited that they must stay in hiding.

The Waldensians (a real group in the real world) attempted to spread subtly anti-corruptor bible stories to the laity through so-called Uncles (as opposed to the "fathers" of the catholic clergy). They would travel, tell stories, and hand out common language translations of the christian bible.

Persecuted mercilessly by the corrupted papacy, the survivors became known as Witches.

Witches are a sparse, world wide affiliation of completely independent women, all of whom are aware of the Corruptor, but all of whom, if they were to use their power openly, would be slain by their own community.

Witches use a kind of sympathy and brewery magic. Following tradition, most witch magic plays on emotions, and utilizes household items common around the world, such as needles and brooms.

All witches can:

* Communicate one to another in dreams, regardless of distance, but in great need  
* Travel great distances covertly on their flying brooms  
* Double their power during a full moon, but half it at a new moon

Witches have specialty gray magic that risks being used for evil, but when so used has knowable consequences:

* SEP fields and minor reality alteration  
* Destroying a nemesis with needles, wool and straw  
* Creating and using a sympathy doll (voodoo doll)  
* Charming people's minds by appealing directly to their spirit, but they realize it later  
* Brewing potions to effect the mind, like love potions

Other capabilities that are light include:

* Disrupt a spirit  
* Convince someone to enter into a bargain that mainly benefits the witch  
* While smoking subtly make a smokescreen for hiding or diversion  
* Plentiful Pot that can cause food for a few to feed many

# MAGIC: OVERVIEW

All supernatural events are mediated by tethered, shackled or haunting Spirits. There is no magic other than this. Supernatural objects always incorporate Spirit Thread.

Magic does not directly damage health, except to the degree that a small child could do so. That is generally limited to 1 point. Magic can, however, hinder things like edge and it very often brings on conditions like sleep, blindness, or madness that affect the victim.

Magic is mysterious and unpredictable. Like human nature, magic can never be entirely predicted. It remains mysterious, hidden, inscrutable. If a character's magic is reliably having the exact same effect over and over something needs to vary.

Magic is subject to the Witness Effect, when perceived by an unbeliever the magic is significantly hampered, which is one reason why so few know about these things.

**MAGIC: SCHOOLS**

A mage must take proficiency in a magic school, and may take more than one. Schools marked with \* are evil, and using capabilities from such schools, no matter how well intentioned, eventually results in a corrupt or evil result.

**MAGIC: CURATIVES**  
Coins woven with Spirit Thread by a Light Spirit Master are the most common curative against curses. For example, a coin under the tongue will speed recovery from cursed blindness. It will also ease the roll of an exorcist to eject a spirit from one possessed.

**MAGIC: SPIRITUAL DEFENSES**

At high levels of power one can begin to acquire spiritual defenses to resist certain effects.

Intention Shield \[IS\] \- Resists mind reading, mind detection etc.  
Reality Discipline \[RD\] \- See the truth of any altered reality around you  
Body Autonomy \[BA\] \- Resist spirit tampering with your body such as blindness, deafness, etc.  
Liberated Mind \[LM\] \- Resist possession of or influence over your mind by a spirit  
Chaos Resistance \[CR\] \- Resist the effects of Bad Luck

**CORRUPTION: CLEANSINGS**

The Corruptor has attempted numerous methods to cleanse the earth of sentient humans, but it is not deterred.

The Corruptor's long-term plan is to help humanity kill itself over long periods of time. The Corruptor has studied humanity in minute detail. While it fails to see some human qualities (loyalty, love) it easily perceives many others (greed, tribalism) that burden humanity. It uses its model of the human mind to devise cleansings that humanity can bring upon itself.

Revelations gradually reveal these potential cataclysms to the players:

(I) Overheating	called Cleansing by Filth  
Carbon consumption driving climate change, started 1859\. England's upcoming Industrial Revolution

(II) Pandemic		called Cleansing by Life  
Biotechnology & genetically modified organisms and engineered pandemic

(III) Torpor		called Cleansing by Futility  
Machinery/AI rendering humans purposeless by making them redundant.

(IV) War		called Cleansing by Fire  
Nuclear or molecular nanotechnology weapons

(V) Asteroid		called Cleansing by Dust  
A rock 12 miles wide hurtles towards earth. The impact will blot out the sun for decades.

(VI) EcoLapse		called Cleansing by Vigor  
Overpopulation driving consumption, commons abuse, and ecological collapse

(VII) Invasives		called Cleansing by Competition  
An invasive species simply out-competes humanity, like carp did to fish in the great lakes

Note: Overheating has the corollary effect of melting the Zocto Ice Wards.

**CORRUPTION: WARDS**

Here is a list of the eight wards created by the Corruptor. Each ward is powered by a storm at the south pole of Jupiter. Seven exist by 1817, and an eighth is under construction. Each ward has a number, a latinized name, an effect, and an avatar. The date the ward came into existence follows.

1st Ward: Concealment (Occultare)  
Effect: The Corruptor shall be aware when anyone speaks Secrets. And bad fortune will attend. Avatar: Egyptian Pharoah Djoser  
2650BC

2nd Ward: Shaping (Formatura)  
Effect: Both minds and the genetic code yield more easily to corruption. Both can be warped to alter the course of human kind.

3rd Ward: Selfishness (Deprava)  
Effect: Leaders pursue self-interest over species or community interest, not caring about others; preserving their own power at all costs, even hate, division, or the ruin of society. includes casual hate. In common men, leads to tragedy of the commons.

4th Ward: Tribalism (Tribala)  
Effect: Causes all humans to look at the "other" with deep suspicion, easily provoked by leaders. This drives war, genocide, racism, etc. including very subtle programs like Indian Schools. Avatar: Olmec King  
600BC

5th Ward: Subjugation (Subjugare)  
Effect: Reduces human qualms against abusively subjugating nature, beasts and other men. Avatar: Bantu King  
0AD

6th Ward: Ignorance (Inscius)  
Effect: Causes the human mind to follow emotion (denialism) and the dictates of authority without question (submission), rejecting the quest for inconvenient truths and evidentiary knowledge. A force multiplier for the 3rd Ward's tools fear, uncertainty and doubt.  
Avatar: Persian Cyrus the Great  
700AD

7th Ward: Gratification  
Effect: All men shall pursue the easy path, embracing easy technologies and denying the future ramifications of their actions. Reduces the personal responsibility required to manage the power of technology safely and sustainably.  
Avatar: Indian/Mongol ruler Timur  
Note: Timur caused 100,000 people to be put to death in a single day upon his ascension as a Ward. [link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_India)  
1400AD

8th Ward: Consumption  
Effect: Humanity embraces global capitalism as a means to power by exploitation of nature and humans, essentially creating a nationalistic arms race of consumption. This will lead to consumption of the commons, extinction-level environmental collapse, and climate overheating.  
Avatar: (in process) British King George III, the Avatar of the Madness of Consumption.   
Circa 1820 AD

**NATURE OF THE CORRUPTOR**

The core nature of the corruptor is:

* It is paranoid, intent on destroying all sentients, whom it fears will inevitably destroy it  
* It overthrows the minds of humanity, subtly directing most towards generational self-destruction, but occasionally taking direct control of certain servants  
* It is a patient psychopath, barely able to stop from killing every sentient it overthrows, yet willing to plan long term for the demise of the human species  
* It greedily gathers minds (or souls if you like) by overthrowing sentient minds  
* It spreads gradually around the globe through "seed" psychopaths transmitting to others  
* It enables human servants to bring "chaos beings" onto the planet to aid its work, in the form of Wards and sometimes other spirit-based manifestations  
* Shackled Spirits are the primary means of its action upon the material world.  
* Lies and astroturfing anti-sentient organizations is also a major tactic  
* It both uses and resists technology. Its long-term view is that tech and automation will always destroy a civilization and therefore destroy it, so it stays generally low-tech.

**ORIGIN OF THE CORRUPTOR**

The Corruptor, as stated, is a kind of warden of the sol system left on Jupiter three million years ago, intended by its creators, the powerful alien civilization known as the Purifex, as a prophylactic against any sentients arising.

Eleven million years ago a starfaring species called "The Mariners" arrived on Mars. The mariners resemble Earth's dolphins, but they are air-breathing and able to levitate and "swim" through the air. The Mariners colonized Mars, and for eight million years they thrived.

Three million years ago the Purifex arrived, bent on destroying any potential competing life forms. The Mariners, using their advanced technology, build a new planet of iron to withstand the onslaught of the Purifex, and surrounded it with a thick shield of stone.

This was effective to some extent. The Purifex created a war tool (the Corruptor) which used slow, stealthy and spiritual means to corrupt and destroy the Mariners from within. Only a small subset of the Mariners escaped destruction by devolving themselves into the dolphins we see on earth today.

After the Purifex moved on they left the Corruptor behind, on Jupiter, with some resources:

1. Stone slave creatures called "Moai", which look like Easter Island statues.  
2. Genetically altered versions of the Mariners, called Orca, which swim both the oceans of worlds and ice rings of Saturn as brutish sentinels to detect the arise of sentients.  
3. Swirling storms of spirit energy at Jupiter's poles which provide sufficient power to create magical Wards.

In more modern times the Corruptor has used the Orca and Moai to eliminated, exile or enslave:

* The machine-like inhabitants of the volcanic moon Io, named the Ioans  
* The octopus-like inhabitants of the moon Europa, named the Zocto  
* The inhabitants of Venus, named the Venusians  
* The simian species called the Zayans
