# GAMEPLAY NARRATIVE

## THE FIFTH WARD

Early gameplay happens substantially in London, where the players are recruited into a mercy mission to "variolate" African natives against smallpox. Their true mission though is to discover how the interests of the crown are being subverted on the Gold Coast of Africa, and why the Ashanti Empire has so much power.

Their guides are the likable Bean and the secretive dwarf Mr. Mump, secretly in the employ of the Illuminati, who secretly collaborate with the Prince Regent to sway the fate of the Empire away from corruption.

On launch day a deep fog engulfs the shipboard celebration, putting many to sleep. Dutch agents attempt assassinations and havoc.

An encounter with a Dutch Agent in Westminster leads them to the tomb of Edward the Confessor, wherein they discover the abbot x (the Prince Regent in disguise), and acquire special coins.

Research in the British Museum leads them to find Grimaldi, a sometime clown and member of the Cult of Purity. Following a floating monkey skull they enter a lost Roman cistern below London, fending off unnatural Gelada monkeys and learning the strange fate of the Zookeeper's wife.

Arriving in La Havre the players learn of an opportunity to steal the fastest ship in the French fleet, a gift from exiled Admiral Soult to persuade Talleyrand to support his return. That ship will later prove crucial against slaver pirates sent to stop them. They arrive at Coast Castle, whence they can embark to the Ashanti capitol of Kumasi. Before that, the Grumbler will take its toll, and skin monsters are discovered helping a corrupt Dutch captain.

On the way to Kumasi the players are ambushed by a supernatural Ashanti warparty, Mr Mump screens them from perception. Austra show up and lead them to Zanadoo, the destroyed city of the Zayans.

In Zanadoo they will learn of the Austra's deep commitment to community, encounter the Zocto aquarium, and find hints about the destruction of the Zayans, and learn the terrible secret of the robot overthrow. As a meteor, thrown thousands of years prior by the Ioans, hurtles toward the city they must escape.

Arriving in Kumasi they must discover the terrible and barbaric secrets of the king, his wax man guardians, and the secret ziggurat in a cavern deep beneath the city. Within, they confront the 5th ward, the Black Opal King who has been using slavery to lend power to the Ashanti and corrupt rival European powers like the Spanish and Dutch.

# The Second Ward

"The Second Ward" is an adventure where the players become connected to a shadowy group of Illuminati and are recruited by the Duke of Wellington to fight against Corruption.

They are given a perilous submersible vessel, the Nautilus, and embark on a journey to Easter Island, where a metal map discovered by the Netsilik Tuktu in the arctic ice suggests tubes riddling through the earth and into the center of the planet.

Along the way, they explore the wreck of the Spanish galleon, the Atocha, meet the arctic explorers Ross and Parry, and discover a silver mine with warped Vesperna and Ooron crystals. Rescuing the crew of an American Whaler, they discover a verdant ice cave, as deep within as Ice Tower with a magical Soul Sphere. The players confront Van Wooten, the Goat Headed Man, deal with the horrifying Medikaran, discover magical viking treasure. They overcome Van Wooten, but the Sphere consumes the souls of hundreds of Ross's sailors and is lost into the Leyden tube.

They rest among the Netsilik, hunting seal for their next voyage, discovering the Zocto Ice Sigils which shield the earth from new Gates from Jupiter.

Finding a Leyden tube they reach Syzygy, the Zocto city which is actually the spaceship used to escape the Corruptor long ago. Avoiding Goliath Crabs they meet "the Artist" and his son "the Explorer". They gain plot revelations and find an upgraded submersible.

At the Earth's center the discover the dead Mariner civilization, and a Soul Collector floating above it. Collecting the Soul Sphere they reach Easter Island.

Adventures below a Puakatike in the Moa Deeps gain futuristic weapons, and the discovery of a portal to Venus, where the Bonapartist French are colonizing. Battling french troops bolstered by evil spirit masters, the heroes scuttle a French submersible and escape.

They clear an abomination from the Hitorangi village well and experiment with weapons. It is revealed that the entire island is actually the ruins of a long dead civilization plundered for souls through the deceptions of the Corruptor and its pawns the Shapers and Moai.

At Rano Kau crate two companions are kidnapped in a spooky stone village. The crater is swamp, containing an enormous tree and dead stone towers. Within, important books reveal a Napoleonic plot and alliance with the Shapers. A meeting with the Witch Coven reveals the plot on King George to shape him into the Eighth Ward.

Brother Lucius returns, revealing that he saw the king in a weird coffin-like thing deep within the tree. The players are worried about trying to enter the tree.

NOW:   
We are going to brainstorm about the next steps for the players. Here is the outline:

* The players discover the Tangata Kau, which lets one become a Champion among the Andromorphs by recovering a sooty tern egg.  
* Using a player's Champion status and the egg the Coven can disguise the others, enabling entry into the tree.  
* Learn George, in a weird coffin-like thing, has been taken to Venus  
* Travel a lava tube to the Moa Deeps  
* Reach Venus and mingle in disguise with Bonapartist elites  
* Hazard the surface of Venus where Moai roam to rescue George

Lets start with the Tangata Kau.

Lets start with getting into the tree.

* Brother Lucius, who was kidnapped by Morph Priests and escaped with his time travel and mental powers, saw George (somewhere) in the tree.  
* The tree is inhabited by  
  * Morph Priests that shape natural creatures into abominable man/beast andromorphs  
  * Andromorohs who have their own society but tolerate and fear the priests  
* The coven, lead by Moira, uses Sympathy magic and has magical Empathy powers. They might aid the players

I know that they must infiltrate the tree, which is inhabited by Morph Priests (that shape natural creatures into abominable andromorphs) and Andromorphs that are men mixed with bats, birds, or fish.

They discover that George (who is alive in a weird coffin) has been moved to Jupiter, so they must take a lava tube to the Moa Deeps where they know there is a gate to Venus. There they discover a rebel group of Andromorphs.

To enter the gate to Venus they must either sneak, or overcome Bonapartist troops supported by Spirit Masters. On Venus, grand ballrooms contain Bonapartist elites, and the trappings of colonization. Players must hazard the surface of Venus and find George.

## THE SECOND WARD \- LONG FORM

Having returned to London from their adventure on the Gold Coast of Africa, the players become connected to a shadowy group of Illuminati, one of whom turns out to be the Prince Regent Geroge IV. He further connects them to the Duke of Wellington as trusted allies in the fight against Corruption.

The Duke shows the players a secret base hidden in the pilings of London Bridge where a submersible, captured during the Napoleonic wars from the Bonapartist forces, is being restored for service. This will be their craft.

**New Submersible**  
It is a strange submersible vessel, designed for underwater travel. It resembles the submarine from 20,000 leagues under the sea. It is clear there has been a horrific fire in its metal interior, and also clear that the French have retrofitted the ship to be usable by human hands. The origin controls are for some other kind of appendage, but it isn't clear what.

During a test run to torpedo a test barge the players learn of the dangers of underwater travel when a spindly octopoid attacks the vessel. They defeat it, discovering that much of the damage was somehow an illusion. They return to base. They christen their ship the Nautilus.

Around this time they also uncover a plot to destroy the vessel, which leads them to a London warehouse where so-called Dutch Agents (actually men of unknown origin) have built up a cache of explosives. They foil the plot.

Each player takes a role on the vessel:

Bolton is Captain  
Henton is the navigator  
Brother Lucius is the pilot, who steers the ship and allocates power  
Throckmorton is engineer handling batteries and power to all systems  
Constance handles weapons such as the grapple and torpedo  
Gahan is the runner, facilitating many tasks

The Duke of Wellington declares that visions have revealed to the trusted mystic Quintus that something terrible on Easter Island threatens the British Monarchy.

It is revealed that an Inuit named Tuktu has found a strange metal map covered with arcane symbols buried in the arctic ice. He delivered it to a British arctic explorer out of gratefulness to a British missionary who saved his life by teaching how to swim.

This disc seems to indicate tubes riddling through the earth, and into the center of the planet.

**Wreck of The Atocha**  
The team sets out. Along the way they go deep to find the sunken Spanish galleon from 1600 called the "Nuestra Senora de Atocha". The team uses primitive leather and bronze diving suits to exit their submersible and explore the wreck.

Throckmorton, using his swimming powers, confronts strange yellow eels with glass teeth in the Captain's cabin. Henton saves Constance and Gahan from a ghost pirate haunting the ship who tangled their breathing tubes. 

The Atocha holds masses of gold and silver, but most of all a great haul of precious emeralds, which they retrieve. Gahan finds the strange Prokithera device, and more gold buried in the silt outside the wreck. Much of the gold is reshaped into hefty golden crosses, which are made to adorn the walls of the submersible.

Dropping much of the loot at a hidden base in Iceland, the team sails towards the coast of what will become Canada.

**Ross and Parry**   
There, as planned, they meet the arctic explorers Captain John Ross and Lieutenant William Parry. Captain Ross commands the Erebus, and large sailing ship that can make good speeds. He has delegated command of the other, slower ship, named the Terror, to Lieutenant Parry.

The ships are anchored, and the team travels to the Erebus for a fine dinner at the table of Captain Ross. During dinner, it becomes clear that Parry is upset because Ross has determined to return to England. They have been exploring for two years. Ross things that is enough. However, Parry argues that there is little evidence that the way on towards the Northwest passage is actually blocked. Ross states that mountains were seen in the distance. Parry is dissatisfied by yields to his superior officer.

Time proves that Parry is a man of action and integrity, able to handle himself and command in a crisis. Parry has befriended the Netsilik, and adopted a sled and dogs. Meanwhile, Ross is cautious and tired of adventure, ready to return to England and not ready to extend much help.

**The American Whaler**  
The next day the team sees the mast of a crushed whaler in the ice. Submerging in the Nautilus to pass intervening ice, they surface and use the submersible's longboats. They arrive to help, experiencing perils, and save the life of the whaler's cook who became trapped by ice. The cook and two companions returned to their foundered ship to gather supplies.

The team learns that this ship is the Acushnet, and that the surviving whaler crew has gone to shore and taken shelter in a large cave behind a glacial waterfall. Arriving on shore they find ruins of ancient Viking dwellings, and white horses that flee behind a waterfall. The cave is discovered to be large, and lenses sunlight from above to create a broad green field with a glacial river flowing down the middle. White horses graze in the verdant field.

Half a mile into the cave they find another ancient and dilapidated Viking building with runes carved here and there. Within, ten drunken Americans tell that their captain Bram Van Wooten has gone deeper into the cave exploring with their first mate.

The team explores another mile into the cave. The ice above them, formerly supplying bright lensed sunlight, is replaced with stone, so the cave grows completely dark. In this darkness they come to an edge, nearly falling in.

**Viking Silver Mine**  
They find a pit thirty feet in diameter that drops down to an unknown distance. It appears to be an ancient silver mine, as they can see smatterings of ore in the walls. Also, carved into the walls, they find passages incised into the vertical pit. Far below they see an orange glow, and feel warmth rising from the pit.

They find coffin-sized stone pits with metal doors, some locked.

Using ancient Viking capstans Constance is lowered into the pit and discovers a warped skeleton, part man and part bird, on a ledge. She also can see that the pit is a Leyden Tube, surrounded by conductive obsidian glass. It is a mysterious discovery.

Strange creatures, called Vesperna fly up from below. They are warped mixtures of men and bats, with large luminous eyes and an unsettling expression. Some players hide in the stone shelters. Others prepare to fight, until they discover that Henton and Lucius are treated with reverence and fear by these beings. The Vesperna are dismissed, but the players feel uncertain about how long it might last.

Constance finds the first mate Brentan in the mined passages that are incised into the pit. She also discovers raw Uranite crystals glowing, and collects them.

**The Ice Tower**  
Nearby, the team discovers a wall of ice called the Ice Veil. Climbing over, they find an unnatural Ice Tower across a plain of solid ice. With the tower, in its central chamber, they find the framework of a sphere, held up by wooden images of Viking dragons. Trapped in this sphere, called the Soul Sphere, they discover the restless spirits of ancient Vikings and earlier explorers, all whirling as if roiled by tornado winds. This is all invisible to the naked eye, but when Henton toches it he feels the tumult.

The team explores four rooms:

* A living area with crude wooden benches and some mica tablets  
* Sleeping quarters with viking objects embedded in long melted wax.  
* A surgery room with an unsettling, hulking spider-like thing called a Medikaran. Within this thing they find a huge blue Vitriol Crystal, and take it.  
* A vat room with ice entombed bodies. Two are men: one with arcane red scarring webbing his face. First Mate Brentan confirms this is his Captain Van Wooten. The other man is seemingly normal, with a long grey beard.

The team, low on resources and health, decides to regroup. Recovering back at the Viking shelter in the cave, one night, a large blue Vitriol Crystal is stolen by a crewman named Rip Hendricks.

**Ice Tower Assault**  
William Parry agrees to aid the party, and they march in force with him and his crewmen, plus crew from the Nautilus, back into the depths of the cave. As they travel they hear Vesperna overhead, and the shouts of Ross's crewmen. Madness has taken the remaining crew, and Vesperna have captured many more, and are bringing them to the Ice Tower for an unknown purpose. It also becomes clear that Captain Ross was taken. His fate is, as yet, unknown.

Breaching the Ice Veil the players' forces come under attack. Some crewmen from Ross's ship seem to go mad, attacking their compatriots. The team finds kidnapped crewmen half buried in the ice of the plain before the Ice Tower. Entering, they see the thief Rip Hendricks within the magical sphere, and more madness takes crewmen.

Furious forces tear at Rip's flesh, but he uses powerful magic to hinder the forward progress of the party. It is clear that this effort will destroy him, yet his face beams with bliss.

Eventually the players attempt to enter the Surgery room, traversing a tunnel strangely filled with mounds of wax. The wax comes to life. It is wax golems, grip at the players, trying to hold them fast as they attempt to move.

**Van Wooten, the Goat Headed Man**  
Within, it becomes clear what Rip Henricks' purpose was: To revive the Medikaran and to free Van Wooten from his icy tomb. Whatever strange cult Van Wooten is a part of, Hendricks is a member as well. Van Wooten's head is now the head of a Goat, reshaped for an unknown purpose, but he fairly glows with arcane power.

The Medikaran helping the now revived Captain Van Wooten to do something unspeakable to the kidnapped Captain Ross, and through him, take control of the men from his own ship, driving them to attack their own companions. Worse, the souls of Ross and his men have been put into the strange soul-capturing Soul Sphere: Hundreds of men loyal to the British Empire. This is what drove them mad., and he speaks in a freakish bleating tongue, tempting them with power, which they reject.

Having met his evil objective, Van Wooten moves to the Sphere, releasing it from its dragon head moorings. A host of Vesperna grab it in their talons and begin to carry it towards the huge pit and the Leyden tube below.

**Lost Souls**  
The sphere sprouts long metal posts surmounted with solid metallic spheres. When it is dropped into the pit, its stabilizes and begins to travel downward, carrying the souls. Constance nearly loses her life jumping after it, but someone saves her. Henton, at the last moment, dispatches one of his tethered spirits into the sphere to report on where it goes and what is happening around it. This is fraught, because that spirit will be in the maelstrom within the sphere.

Having lost the valuable Soul Sphere the players return and free the other ice-entombed man, discovering that he claims to be Cabot, a 16th century British arctic explorer with an Italian heritage. He tells of Vesperna attacks on his ships, and has trouble believing that two hundred years have passed.

Upon their return to the Nautilus, Beard tells that he has found levers that might enable the Nautilus to travel a Leyden Tube to the center of the earth, and then up to Easter Island.

**Netsilik Visit**  
The players sail to Tuktu's home, the Netsilik camp. There they meet

* Kabloka the tibe headwoman  
* Qimmiq a widow who makes eyes at Throckmorton and cares for them all  
* Kumaglak the seasoned hunter who guides them on seal hunts

They hunt seal to stock up on food before entering the Leyden tubes. During this time Constance falls through the ice. Throckmorton, using his animal sympathy powers, dives in to save her an discovers mysterious runes hundreds of miles in size carves underneath the polar ice caps.

At the Netsilik camp they learn about the culture, including competing in games of strength and dexterity. Henton sees the spirits of babies slain to keep the balance of men and women in the harsh arctic environment. The grandfather Arfeq, knowing he can no longer contribute, walks alone into the night. Constance recovers from her fall through the ice.

In another venture they find an ice pyramid with the Frenchman Robespierre, notorious for the 40,000 deaths during the Reign of Terror and thought dead, alive and living with Netsilik servants. He explains away his presence, is cordial and genial, and leads them to a mystery.

The mystery is huge black objects that look like goats-head stickers, puncturing the arctic ice. Nearing them causes meat to rot. It is later revealed that these were sent by the Corruptor to puncture and disrupt the protective Zocto Ice Sigils.

At camp more stories are shared. They hear of the Tupilak, a monster composed of the bones of many creatures, that avenges deaths. They hear about Avovang, who lived as the spirit of many creatures. The shaman woman Meriwa talks with Henton about String Figures.

\===

**Syzygy City**  
With enough seal meat they embar in the Nautilus, find a Leyden tube, and descend. This helps them follow the path of the Soul Sphere, which contains so many troubled spirits that must be freed. Henton checks with his dispatched spirit, who tells that the sphere has come to rest in a massive stone chamber deep within the earth.

The Nautilus descends the air-filled obsidian tube for two days, passing lava beyond the translucent walls of the tube. They arrive at a membrane that leads to water, and find themselves in a massive water-filled cave, many miles across.

Far below them in the cave is a forest of giant kelp, and hidden with are tall, one hundred and twenty foot tall alien crabs similar to giant spider crabs, called "Goliath Crabs". They spy a huge underwater city that looks almost like a space craft. It is the city of Syzygy, three miles around and covered by some sort of clear glass dome over a mile tall. Upon inspection it appears the dome has been broken through in places, and that the city is empty.

Finding an entrance below the dome they take the Nautilus inside and are surprised to discover that their submersible perfectly fits into the docking area, as if they were made for each other. On the docks they find a damaged Octomech, a kind of giant octopoid robot meant to be piloted by a Zocto. It appears powerful. The docking area, and most areas they travel, are covered with strange knobby rocks that later are revealed to be baby Goliath crabs.

Initial explorations discover a kind of temple, with a huge mural on the wall. The mural reveals that the city is in fact a spaceship-city created by the Zocto to flee from Jupiter to Earth. It shows the city's construction and space voyage to Earth. To achieve similar pressures to their home, they bring the ship city to the deepest caves under Earth's oceans. There the city thrives for a time, until one day a gate from Jupiter opens and Goliath crabs pour through, destroying everything in their path.

The mural reveals that, realizing the fight is lost, the remaining Zocto carve protective sigils into Earth's ice caps to prevent the magic that opened the gate from Jupiter. Then the remnants flee, reverting to a more primitive society.

Unbeknownst to the players, one splinter group of these will, someday, uplift the Zayans, help them build and hide their city Zanadoo, and live for centuries in the "aquarium", only to be discovered by the players days before Zanadoo's final destruction by a meteor.

Further exploration of Syzygy reveals:

* A warehouse wherein they find chemistry technology  
* A Guide Room, where the immersive virtual reality mechanism called a Guide resides.  
* A nursery, formerly used to grow Zocto babies  
* An armory, with Zocto-specific hand to hand weaponry, two implosion torpedoes, and six Dark Stars  
* An ooron refinery, and the bridge of the ship  
* A forge for creating environment suits  
* An engine room with a huge hadron reactor and an Ooron capsule  
* The bridge of the spaceship city, including a globe of Venus

On the bridge they meet a Zocto searching for the history of its people. His appellation is The Artist, and he has traveled through many dangers with his son, The Explorer. Joining forces with these two, the players continue explorations.

As they return to their docked craft, the hundreds of baby Goliath crabs, scenting the Zocto, unfold and begin pursuing and then attacking. The team barely gets to their ship in time, and there are some minor injuries. At some point the Artist gets into the Octomech in the docks and uses it to fight.

**Revelations**  
The players use the Guide, but it is not calibrated for humans and they learn little. After meeting The Artist, they help him to use the guide. As a result he reveals a great deal of information, including:

* He clarifies the mural, as already described  
* He talks about the mighty history of his people  
* He reveals that the Zocto uplifted the Zayans  
* The cavern contains both Jovian and Earth creatures  
* He has learned to refine Ooron  
* He has learned to make Jupiter-ready environment suits

**New Submersible**  
In addition, he reveals that there is a second set of docks within Syzygy, and there are ships there. The party, which dislikes and fears their current craft, eagerly visits these docks. Through some misadventures, they sneak past a Goliath crab that has taken residence in that dock, explore three new ships, and acquire a new ship, which is also a submersible, that they name the Europa Resplendent.

It is 30' long, built for speed and maneuverability. A gun on deck with a rifled barrel seems to lack ammunition, but has an eight shot revolver loading mechanism. A strange device creates a forcefield so that one may stand on deck even when the ship is under water. The controls of the ship are clearly Zocto controls, and it takes everyone a while to get used to using them.

Knowing they must continue to the center of the earth to find the Soul Sphere, the party agrees that The Artist will stay behind, refine the ooron crystals found by Constance, and build the party Jupiter-ready environment suits. The Explorer will accompany the group to in their adventures.

The players in the Europa, and the Artist in the octomech, battle Goliath crabs to allow the Europa to continue down the Leyden tube. After another day they reach nearly the center of the earth, and make numerous discoveries.

**The Mariners**  
The Soul Sphere is in the chamber they discover, and they load it onto the deck of their ship. Following a gigantic passage they come upon a dramatic sight.

It is a huge, spherical, open space within the earth. From their perspective they are coming out of the ceiling. A few miles below them an unfathomably large iron sphere spins. Upon the face of that sphere remnants of an ancient culture cling. May miles away a huge, bloated creature floats. Roughly the shape of a malformed, bloated tick, with tentacles on its proboscis and glowing pods on its body, it is a Soul Catcher. Henton and Lucius can see souls from the world above being drawn towards it, and then captured in the glowing pods. It is fearsome to look at. The team quietly sneaks away.

After consulting with their navigator, Beard, they ascend another Leyden tube and successfully reach Easter Island.

**Easter Island**  
Upon landing they meet a primitive sailing vessel. It is a ship of Makassan trepangers, capturing and drying sea cucumbers. They trade with the players, and share news. Their chief and ship captain, Pobasoo, reports a rich harvest, but three curses. First, many unexplained deaths of trepang divers. Second, abominations visited their shore camp in the night. Third, a pox that kills his men.

The players variolate the Makassans to stave off the small pox. While doing so they find a man who is beginning to transform into a bird. It is a disturbing sight.

The players cross the island, finding the village of Hitorangi. The headwoman insists that their blood be tested before entering, to be certain they have not been Changed. This is something she and the whole village fear.
