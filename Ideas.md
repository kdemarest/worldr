# Resource Extraction

capital extracts value from the environment: mining, cutting trees, freely polluting, basically the tragedy of the commons.

but humans are also the ambient environment. the realm of ideas likewise.

and the Corruptor knows this. if you can utterly sap sentience, choice, autonomy and will, and arrive at a functional but unthinking set of entities, that is acceptable to it.

Therefore, to use AI to relentlessly regulate is acceptable. Likewise to deconstruct the mentality network, as in the case of the Venusians, such that they self-constrain forever is equally fine.

it is mentality networks that might compete with it that are problematic.

still an outstanding problem: why not simply genetically engineer them into an inability to reproduce? then they'd be gone...

# Outlawing the Slave Trade

Outlawing the slave trade in 1807 gives Britain breathing room vs Corruption, leading somewhat to the state of the game in 1817. When the Napoleonic war began in 1803, with George IV's shadow government supporting him, within four years Napoleon discovered the link between inhuman behavior and being prone to corruption. Outlawing the slave trade was the idea of William Wilberforce (Parliament), Bishop of London Beilby Porteus, and prime minister Lord Grenville. Curtailing the slave trade harmed other countries more than Britain, so it passed, and bought all of Britain more time and access to Corrupt Secrets. Wilberforce, by the way, dies three days after slavery itself is abolished in 1833.

# Silver's Importance

The Chinese Qing dynasty required silver, and only silver, for tax revenue. Silk and tea were therefore purchased in Mexican silver "pieces of eight", draining European coffers, and prompting the British opium pipeline from Bengal/Calcutta to China.

By 1817, the 1810 Hidalgo revolt and the broader independence war:

* slashed the world’s primary silver supply,  
* weakened Spain fatally,  
* destabilized China’s monetary base,  
* and pushed Britain deeper into using opium as a silver-extracting machine,  
* affecting financial circuits from London to Calcutta to Canton.

The “local” rebellion absolutely had **global economic consequences**.

## Destruction of Spain

When Napoleon drove out the Bourbons in 1808, Spain’s colonies rallied under the liberal Cádiz Constitution, believing they were fighting both for Spain and for a more just political order.

However, the weakening of Spain's formal authority in Mexico (King Ferdinand imprisoned by Napoleon) allowed the Hidalgo revolt \- fueled by illuminati as part of the "Napoleon Plan" to reduce the power of puppets of the Corruptor.

Local leaders in New Spain, New Granada, and Peru interpreted the crisis as a chance to claim real representation—an escape from the old absolutist structures they had long resented. For a moment, it looked as though the empire might reform itself.

 But when Ferdinand VII was restored in 1814, he immediately abolished the constitution, dismissed colonial deputies, and reimposed the very absolutism they had just bled to oppose. To the colonies, this was not simply political betrayal; it was the return of an oppressive force they thought they had helped expel.

In brief, the monarchy destroyed itself, ensuring the Hidalgo revolt which destroyed its silver mine cash cow.

Why? Because illuminati reached the beseiged Cadiz and saw a future where belief in a liberal egalatarian constitution would rend power from even a restored Spanish monarchy. They instigated the Cadiz Constitution, and years later it worked.

# Union of Salvation

This was a real thing that formed in early Russia as a result of elite officers seeing Western governance not based on serfdom.

Many, such as Trubetskoy and Ryleyev, were part of the victorious Russian army that had marched into Paris in 1814\.

Upon return, they were disillusioned by the contrast between Western political freedoms and Russia’s autocracy and serfdom.

Between 1816–1817 they formed **the first secret political circle**, the *Union of Salvation* (*Soiuz Spaseniya*), a small, secret reformist society of officers seeking a constitutional government and abolition of serfdom.

This organization later evolved into the *Union of Welfare* (1818–1821), which split into the Northern and Southern Societies that eventually carried out the 1825 revolt.

The revolt began when troops loyal to the conspirators gathered in Senate Square, St. Petersburg, refusing to swear allegiance to the new Tsar Nicholas I after Alexander I’s death. They demanded a constitution.

* Leadership collapsed almost immediately; the designated commander, **Prince Trubetskoy**, did not appear.

* Loyalist artillery fired grapeshot into the crowd, killing or wounding several hundred. The revolt was crushed within hours.

The players should meet Ryelev, sincere in his desire to change the lot of Russian serfs, who is hosted by the illuminati in London  yet has not been let in on the secrets.  And meet Trubetskoy, who is a mole, deeply corrupted, and in 1825 will betray the movement to their deaths.

This is intentional by the corruptor, and mirrors what Britain did to the Luddites. In fact, Constance should discover later that her office's work against the luddites might have been Corrupted.

# Barber of Seville

### **Gioachino Rossini (1792–1868)**

* **The sensation of Europe in 1817\.**

* His operas *The Barber of Seville* (1816) and *La Cenerentola* (1817) were smash hits.

* London was mad for Rossini — theaters staged his works constantly.

* He represented youth, wit, and modernity.

* His fame eclipsed almost everyone else for a time.

# Beethoven's Fifth is First played in London

The **Philharmonic Society of London** plays it. It was seen as bold, intense, and modern, far more dramatic than the Haydn-Mozart symphonies London knew. Admired for its power, yet stodgy critics can be overheard "too wild", "too German\!"

# Nocturne 10

Irish pianist John Field invented the nocturne and although he lived in Moscow by this time he might have visited London. 

In a salon one might have heard is nocturne 10 which could also be an interesting ambient piece to play in the background of a gaming session.

# London Broadwood Pianos

**Broadwood (London):** John Broadwood & Sons were producing some of the finest grand pianos of the era, favored by Beethoven and other major composers.

**Edward Troughton (London):** Leading maker of astronomical and surveying instruments, producing sextants and theodolites of extreme precision.

**Jesse Ramsden (d. 1800\)** and **Troughton & Simms (successor firm)** were the benchmark in optical and navigational devices.

**Henri Gambey:** Built astronomical and geodetic instruments; rising in prominence around 1817\.

# Violins Calm Spirits

In 1816 the passing of **Lorenzo Storioni in Cremona Italy** (the “Cremonese Revival” school) ended the Stradivari tradition of violin making. These violins, when played, elicited spirit visions, as well as calming cursed or angry spectres. Agents of corruption had been working to destroy them for a century.

# Niccolo Paganini

In 1817 Pagannini would be touring London.  
Paganini performed feats no one else could: his **Caprices for Solo Violin** included left-hand pizzicato while bowing, lightning runs on one string, artificial harmonics that imitated flutes.

He made the violin look supernatural — audiences thought he had “sold his soul.”

In fact he is a member of the corruptor cult. Is his music summons spirits to be devoured by the soul eaters or in public to convert regular people to cult members.

His concerts were large, very public events — crowds shouted, fainted, demanded encores.

# Fodder \- Galvanism

## Electric Kiss

Parties were held around Europe in which an attractive young lady was invited to stand on a block of insulating resin, and she was given a moderate static charge from a spinning globe. A young man from the audience was then invited to give her a kiss, and, in the process, the pair received a reasonable shock.

Beatification eg a kings crown under a rather large prime Conductor.

## Corpse Reanimation

Dr Galvani believed that if he stimulated the fluid that connected the nerves to the entire body, he could reverse the effects of death. His nephew, Aldini, applied electrical impulses to the corpses using a battery, the animals’ heads would shake from side to side, their eyeballs would roll, and their tongues would roll out of their mouths.

Giovanni Aldini, nephew to Dr. Galvani, did electric experiments on severed ox heads and human corpses of the convicted. Known to the players as "Galvanism" which eventually became synonymous with using electricity to reanimate a corpse (contrasted with Voltism which believed that using different kinds of metals would generate electricity, without understanding that a catalyst was required)

Mary Shelley heard of these experiments...

At some point we have to have some kind of a dead face getting animated by electricity to appears if it is speaking blinking and making facial expressions. Gruesome but clearly necessary to

Aldini even, unbelievably, did an experiment where he treated depression with electricity and direct stimulation to the brain. And it worked. Unbelievable.

The players should encounter some kind of moment where either a light and jar or a voltaic battery is used to keep someone alive by direct stimulation to the heart.

San Genesio had the Pope drink the blood of three ten-year-old boys in the world's first blood transfusion, but this failed, as the Pope died on 25 July 1492\. That same day, Della Rovere had an assassin stab him in the chest with his dagger, before another assassin approached him from behind and slit his throat.

# **Plot Ideas**

Sequence of mysteries

- Who are these guys asking us to sail around and document artifacts?  
- Why are those tribes people acting so insane about attacking this fort?  
- What are all these skeletons dead on Easter Island for?

Plot Devices

- Upgrade the ship over time  
- Marry or bring along a freed native  
- Discovery of a lost world  
- Slave revolt aboard the [Tryal](https://www.wnyc.org/story/on-this-spanish-slave-ship-nothing-was-as-it-seemed/)  
- Blown off course, but must free a tribe to survive because they need help  
- Some are aware of what they are, others are not (the veil is thin here). Those that know are hostile beyond belief.  
- Give the players a map of hotspots that they can choose to visit; it starts with just one, but missives arrive  
- Over time they get maps from research done by pre-explorers, by guides, or balloonists that visited places  
- Missives: Arrive by carrier albatross with new locations, unlocks for their artifacts, or cryptic warnings related to certain areas they might visit; sometimes an imperative command  
- Maybe the decision of where to go next  
- Voodun sympathy magic exists in many tribes  
- Meet famous luminaries, like Livingstone (deeply against slavery) and Amundsen  
- Players should discover important real-world places, like Victoria Falls, Machu Picchu  
- Players must perform a pilgrimage, acting in certain ways, to gain entrance to certain holy places  
- Find easter island, covered in skeletons all lying in place  
- Early in game an exorcism, trying but failing to get the corruptor out of someone. So, there must be a better way  
- Also see an exorcism trying to get the corruptor INTO someone. Eg somebody realizes at the last moment that the exorcist is missing just the right teeth and has been wearing fakes.  
- There should be signs of the corruptor's influence, but only one type per tribe: missing hands, fingers, eyes, ears. Enemies burned on a wheel or buried to their neck with insects swarming them.  
- Whole tribe is actually eyeless, but the PCs can't see it due to a curse. Except maybe one.  
- Rats on the ship are spies for the corruptor; captain looks kind of crazy as he runs about stuffing every crack in his cabin, whispering "we can't let the rats get in"  
- Find a ghost ship, and in the hold, corrupted people who don't need food or water, pop out of crates

# British in India

The fourth anglo-Mysore war settled south India around 1804\. Wellington had a major impact, was appointed governor through patronage, and suppressed remaining feudal lords, again winning hearts and minds to do so.

In alignment with the RB campaign, much of the British success was due to Lord Tippu's harsh repression of his own lords, who leaked information to the British.

The **Third Anglo-Maratha War (1817–1818)** — which begins *in 1817* — is the finishing blow. After it, the Peshwa is deposed, Maratha territories are annexed, and the British become unchallenged rulers of India outside Punjab and Nepal.

# Tambora

Tambora dropped world temps three degrees, and changed Bengal's weather enough for cholera to erupt, and spread like wildfire.

But it also warmed the arctic, melting enough ice that a potential northwest passage might be open, and prompting the Ross expedition.

* Company armies lost huge numbers while campaigning (e.g., in the Maratha War of 1817–1818)

Cholera struck armies so hard that it changed campaign plans.

What would the cholera pandemic of 1817 have been like? What was its extent at that time

###### **ChatGPT said:**

First pandemic. Origin in the Ganges delta. Rapid, lethal, and poorly understood. Here’s the concise picture.

## What it was like (conditions and experience, 1817–1818 phase)

* Onset: Sudden violent diarrhea and vomiting, dehydration fast enough to kill within hours. Skin turning blue from shock. No effective treatment; people simply collapsed and died.  
* Popular perception: It looked supernatural. In Bengal it was called *visuchika* (a traditional term for severe cholera). Europeans described it as “spasmodic cholera.”  
* Mortality: Case-fatality was extremely high—commonly 30–50% in local accounts, sometimes worse in confined environments such as ships or cantonments.  
* Spread pattern: It did not creep; it leapt along rivers, military roads, and trade routes. Troop camps, pilgrim routes, and river landings were the flashpoints.  
* Administration response: The East India Company was baffled; they had no germ theory, no concept of fecal contamination, and no effective quarantine strategy. Measures were ad hoc—movements restricted, encampments relocated, but nothing worked.  
* Atmosphere: Panic in towns; abandonment of sick relatives was common. Markets emptied; religious interpretations proliferated. British officers wrote of whole villages temporarily deserted.

Bengal: active outbreak, high mortality, sudden deaths in markets and near rivers.

British cantonments: heavy losses, fear, hurried sanitary measures (mostly useless).

River towns along the Ganges: panic, deserted ghats, boats refusing passengers.

Pilgrimage routes: superspreaders.

Trade hubs (Calcutta, Madras, Bombay): periodic waves.

Spread: 1817–1824

* **1817–18**: Bengal → Bihar → Odisha.  
* **By 1819**: Bombay, Sri Lanka, Burma, Thailand, Indonesia.  
* **By 1821**: Persia, Oman, the Gulf.  
* **By 1823–24**: Russian Empire and parts of the Middle East.  
  It reached **China and Japan** later in the 1820s.

The first irrigation works undertaken during East India Company's rule were begun in 1817\. Consisting chiefly of extensions or reinforcements of previous Indian works, these projects were limited to the plains north of Delhi and to the river deltas of the [Madras Presidency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madras_Presidency).

\#\# Calcutta, 1817: Atmosphere, Cultural Forces, and the Anglicist–Orientalist Split

\#\#\# General Atmosphere  
\- Transitional, argumentative, and self-conscious about “modernity.”  
\- A rising Bengali elite hungry for Western science and English education.  
\- Older Company scholars entrenched in Sanskrit–Persian traditions.  
\- Missionaries active but constrained; printing presses proliferating.  
\- Fort William College fading; Hindu College (1817) emerging as a cultural pivot.

\#\#\# Key Forces  
\- \*\*Orientalists:\*\*    
  \- Senior Company officials and scholars.    
  \- Favor Sanskrit/Persian scholarship; preserve Indo-Persian administrative models.    
  \- Believe rule requires legitimacy through traditional learning.

\- \*\*Anglicists:\*\*    
  \- Younger officials, utilitarians (Mill influence), missionaries, reformist Bengalis.    
  \- Push English-medium education and “useful knowledge.”    
  \- Want a new intermediary class shaped by British ideas.

\- \*\*Bengali Elite (Urban, Educated):\*\*    
  \- Funding Hindu College; frustrated with classical curricula.    
  \- Seeking social mobility through English and Western science.    
  \- Beginning to fragment into conservative vs. reformist groups.

\- \*\*Missionaries:\*\*    
  \- Pressing for vernacular literacy and English instruction.    
  \- Provide printing, translation, and practical schooling infrastructure.

\#\#\# Structural Context  
\- Persian still official for courts; Sanskrit College still active.    
\- London pressure: utilitarian ideology pushing “improvement” over preservation.    
\- EIC bureaucracy split between traditional administrators and modernizers.

\#\#\# Net Effect in 1817  
\- Calcutta becomes a battleground of educational ideology.    
\- Hindu College signals the ascendancy of the Anglicist vision.    
\- Cultural authority is shifting from classical scholarship to Western science and English prose.    
\- The Company’s ruling philosophy is starting to tilt from “rule through existing systems” to “reform India through English education.”
