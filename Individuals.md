On the day of the dedication ceremony, you arrived at St. Chads quite early and were given a tour, but also had a long period of waiting.

Also present was your acquaintance (and Tawnsy's very good friend) financier Doctor Robert Darwin. When his eight year old son Charles confessed to you that he was baptized in that church "but now we attend Unitarian chapel", you took pity on the lad's boredom. You told him stories of your travels around the world, to America, to Borneo and more. He was fascinated and swore upon his honor that he also would become a great explorer. You listened patiently as he spoke about learning all about the natural world at Unitarian day school.

### George IV, Prince Regent (link)
PIC  
Tier 5  
Specialized in British Symbology  
Contacts in the BTs  
Trained in using any object as a weapon  
Specialized in BT lore

Equipment:
* Curtana the Sword of Mercy, strapped to his back or waist  
* Royal Ring  
* Edward's Regalia

Prince Regent of England, Ireland and Hannover, is obese, addicted to laudanum, and more concerned with style and affairs of the heart than affairs of state. His wife Queen Caroline, departed for the continent three years ago and has not returned since. His father, George III, still lives, in various stages of intermittent dementia, thrusting the Prince Regent unwillingly into state affairs from time to time for the last six years. As the Napoleonic wars drew to a close, George took a deeper interest in state matters. Under George's influence the Regency style is emerging, with clothes by Beau Brummel, and architecture like Regent's Park and Regent Street, and the seaside spa Brighton Pavilion (6 hours by carriage south of London) developed as a fantastical seaside palace by architect John Nash in the "Indian Gothic" style.

His coronation in 1821 will stink of decadence.

George is not the foppish style-admiring dandy who wastes money on stables that he appears to be. In secret he works against the Corruptor in alliance with the Benedictines. It is this humanity-saving distraction which keeps him from the apparently more important affairs of state.

George's hidden marriage to Maria Fitzherbert is actually part of the BT breeding program, of which he is an informed and committed participant. They have several children, all of whom have been shipped off elsewhere.

He is a skilled Pistoleer, and keeps two loaded miniature flintlocks hidden either upon his person or nearby at all times. They are 0.71 calibre horse pistols stamped with the crown of king George III.

George IV moves about incognito often as an Benedictine Abbot from Sicily, going to seek wisdom by carefully reading Edward's Seal and other symbology upon the tomb of his ancestor.

Edward the Confessor, like George IV, feigned one persona in public and waged war against the Corruptor, discovering many secrets, the most important of which he had inscribed upon his casket in encrypted code. Edward ordered assassinations, for example, of Rhys ap Rhydderch, when fixing the corruption was impossible. That tradition intersects with the Alien Office during the Napoleonic wars.

### George St. James
PIC  
George is a Scottish capitalist who expanded his territory by bribing servants of his rival, and ruthlessly evicting Irish tenants at Lismore to build lace factories and employ near-slave labor. His wealth expanded then through lace factories that used children. In collaboration with the 6th Duke of Devonshire (the Bachelor Duke) he spent the money to rebuild his castle at Lismore entirely in the gothic style.

Overthrown, due to treating people without care or remorse.

### Grandma Himmelsgucker
PIC  
An old German woman who runs a small palmistry shop in London, but has also been known to travel. She knows how to properly read the sky to gain indications of the future.

In snow or on the sea, he prefers to use his Goldoni Glasses PIC, PIC assuming they have been retrieved from the medikaran chamber.

Cabot was thought to be lost at sea on his second voyage, commissioned by king Henry VII of England, to New Found Land in 1498. Despite his name, he is Italian (from Venice) and speaks with a slight accent.

* He still believes he is on his 1498 third voyage, seeking a route to Cathay with five ships and 200 men, merely replenishing water. He thinks it is June.  
* He will recognize a painting PIC of his first ship, the "Matthew", hanging in the sub's mess hall.

### Joseph Bonaparte
PIC PIC LINK  
Older brother to Napoleon, he trained as a Lawyer and diplomat, serving in the Cinq Cents and the Council of Ancients, eventually helping his brother overthrow the Directory. He became the king of Naples (where he was popular) and then Spain (which never accepted him and which he never fully controlled).

Bonaparte built a sumptuous estate in 1816 called Point Breeze MAP in Bordentown, N.J., just south of Trenton, between the power centers of New York City and Philadelphia. He built atop a promontory that allowed him to see any hostile forces and perforated the grounds with tunnels that allowed quick escape, if necessary, to a boat on Crosswicks Creek, and from there to the Delaware River.

### Joseph Grimaldi
PIC, COSTUMED, LINK  
The most popular entertainer of the day, who transformed clowning into substantially what it is today. He was popular for extremely athletic shows plus songs like "Hot Codlins" (about a street seller of baked apples) that the crowd could sing along to. Joe started at Drury lane at age 9, after his father died, for one pound a week. His mother was allowed to work as a dancer. 29 years later, injuries, ostensibly from clowning, are slowing him down, but his son is taking up his father's craft.

Currently playing in "The Talking Bird" at Covent Garden Theatre, where he has just introduced "Hot Codlins." Grimaldi sought inspiration for the character of the apple seller by walking around the streets of London and observing real-life tradespeople.

### JS Grimaldi
COSTUMED LINK  
Son of famed Joseph Grimaldi, JS resents the unfavorable comparisons he gets. He increasingly turns to alcohol, and runs with a bad crowd.

* She uses overly emotional descriptors in her speech  
* Convincing the souls dc 7 to get attention, and dc 7 to restore their fascist monarchist hierarchy  
* The first three generations, landed by lies from the corruptor, died in hundreds of thousands. Their nobles had pride, noblesse oblige, and almost Japanese code of conduct.  
* All that was lost as the leadership accepted the robotic suits, the warm warm robotic suits, from the corruptor. And the Golem crystals in the suits brainwashed them all.  
* All except the occasional Obscura like Irella.  
* The old leaders things the new ones are traitors and deserve to be Shelled and Salted.

### Kofi Asante Akyem
Okyenhene of the Akyem, uncle of Afia Dokuaa. He knows there is a problem with the Ashanti, and he wants to help, but they are too powerful for his tribe to confront directly.

He smiles too much, and gives too much, so he can seem untrustworthy, but he has an honest heart.

### Mateu Orfila
DEETS  
Master toxicologist and famed singer. Published the best known book on poisons and antidotes. Member of Paris Academy of Science.

### Osei "Kwad" Kwadwo
PIC, PIC  
An Ashanti in a tailored suit, wearing bifocal glasses made by Ben Franklin, with nearly perfect English, who just graduated with a degree in economics from Oxford. You can just call him Kwad, but not Osei because that is an honorific.

* Kwad fears that a mind fever, similar to that of King George III, is affecting his uncle Tutu, the Asantehene of the Ashanti.  
* Kwad is not in the imperial line, but hopes to become "house father" whom in his courtyard hut all will obey  
* Aware that slavery drives the economy of his country, and is the only thing keeping them strong enough to avoid European colonization, but despises the practice.

Researcher for the Alien Office. Always breakfasts at the same cafe, reads the same paper. Historian, culturally knowledgeable about all Europe.

### Richard Arkwright
aka: Arkwright
PIC LINK  
Ultra-wealthy inventor of the cotton spinning frame, and "father of the modern factory." He had a breakdown when he saw factories ruining the lives of children and bringing hardship to traditional craftsmen. He "found god", became an egalitarian, and a major funder of the expedition. At 60 years of age he has signed up as a barber on the ship to escape what he considers the horrors of industrial England, and reconnect with regular people.

Flaw: Estimates that less educated, less experienced, or more poorly tempered men can do anything he can do. Which is quite a lot.

### Richard "Bean" Gilroy
aka: Bean, Richard Gilroy
PIC  
Tier 4 - Charming, Guarded, Strong Willed Speaker who Serves Humanity  
Trained: Corrupt knowledge 1, Resist corruption, On-the-fly encryption and decryption  
Specialized: Poseur, Perception, Secret-keeping, Mental discipline  
Ability: Fight weaponless (e), Resist drugs (e), Resist torture

A regular looking fellow with a twinkle in his eye and not a care in the world. His jaunty hat and frock coat show him to be a study of fashion. You would invite him to your birthday party.

Possibly patterned after, or in fact is, Thomas Weld, future Cardinal and nephew to Maria Fitzherbert's first husband. Weld also persuaded the Pope to validate George IV's marriage to Fitzherbert.

Bean is both light hearted and casually formal, addressing everyone as "Mr. this" and "Mrs. that" (or Sir and Dame as required). Although he seems like a regular administrator, and rather naive, he cultivates this. He believes in what the Benedictines are doing, was trained as a monk, and eventually joined the BTs.

### Maria Fitzherbert
Daniel's aunt. Cousin to Cardinal Weld. Incredibly attractive, almost overwhelmingly so. 

### Robert Boyle
Long Dead: Essentially invented chemistry. From Listmore but did all his work in London. Robert Boyle is considered the father of chemistry, but he dabbled in alchemy, as well. In fact, he was so committed to the alchemical cause that he fought to make alchemy legal, since Henry IV had banned it (because alchemy wasn't good for the monetary supply). Needless to say, the repeal wasn't necessary.

Alchemists developed extensive symbolism and wrote numerous manuscripts in secret codes, all as part of an elaborate process to weed out those who were unworthy of their lofty goals

Newton's recipe for philosophic mercury was originally written by an American chemist named George Starkey, Voelkel said. Starkey studied at Harvard University and moved to England in 1650 to work with eminent chemists of the time. He ended up working with Robert Boyle, one of Newton's contemporaries. But Starkey published under the pseudonym Eirenaeus Philalethes, allowing him to control other chemists' access to his experiments, Voelkel said.

### Silent, The
Perhaps the magnetic Great Blue Spot is the seed for the next god. It would be amusing if the corruptor's main battle wasn't with earth, and was in fact focused on Jupiter or into its home dimension.

### Shouter, The French
PIC@  
* His name is Pierre.  
* He shouts secrets to you so you incur bad luck listening to them. Yes, you can gain (typically reagent) secrets, but there is much risk.  
* When surrounded by French troops he does it in English so that the troops won't understand the information, although they would generally not be affected anyway because they are corruption-aligned.

### St. Chad's Church
Scottish architect George Steuart was commissioned to build a new church, and he submitted several preliminary designs. Due to a misunderstanding, Steuart went on to complete a circular plan which was not the Parish Church Council's preferred design; however, time was limited, and this was the design which was built.[8][9]  
The foundation stone was laid on St Chad's day, 2 March 1790. The church was built of white Grinshill stone.[8][9] The building work was supervised by John Simpson (who later worked on several projects with Thomas Telford, including the Pontcysyllte Aqueduct). Internally, the gallery was supported by slender cast iron pillars, an early example of cast iron used for this purpose; they were made by William Hazledine, a pioneering ironmaster who had a foundry in Shrewsbury.

### Tawnsy Shropshire (Lady Hortense)
PIC@  
The widow Lady Hortence "Tawnsy" Shropshire was the wife of the late Lord Archibald "Archy" Shropshire. Archy's father Harold was an incredible man, wealthy, emblematic of the dignity and honor of the empire, and an Admiral of the Royal Navy. When Harold was killed in France during the War of the First Coalition 25 years ago, Archy (with Tawnsy's support - they were engaged at the time) decided to fund a magnificent replacement of St. Chad's church in Shrewsbury in Lord Harold's honor. The new church is a work of art (PIC). When Archy died in action during the Burning of Washington (you were feet from him when it happened), Tawnsy decided to co-dedicate the beautiful new church to both Harold and Archy. You were visiting to be there for the commemoration, and comfort her in her grief.

Lady Hortense "Tawnsy" Shropshire: She appreciates Bolten as a friend of her late husband and she might call on him when she is feeling nostalgic. She is a bit of a confidant and knows quite a bit of Bolten's life. She is a power contact and could be a patron for Bolten. When discussing her husbands death, Bolten is evasive. She has heard the rumors that Bolten was somehow responsible, but she doesn't believe them because despite his evasiveness, Bolten feels sorrow but not guilt.

### Ali Eisami (William Harding)
A boy named Ali Eisami reports this is how it was when the British captured his slave ship. He had been captured in 1817, when a radical West African cleric named Usman dan Fodio swept through what is now Nigeria in a jihad and sold him into slavery. He said this happened when the British attacked the ship he was on.:  
“The slave ship fired nine times at the British but they kept their course and fired back. The mainmast toppled and the white slavers ran to the bottom of the ship to hide. The other ship rammed her way alongside and men came over the rails with cutlasses in their hands.”  
“We sat down and they took off all the fetters from our feet and threw them into the water and they gave us clothes that we might cover our nakedness. We also ate food till we had enough. We said, ‘now our Lord has taken us out of slavery,’ and thanked him.”  
That ship was remasted and with a British commanding officer and flag and the former slave ship turned round and made its way to Freetown, Sierra Leone. Freetown was where the West African Squadron was based.

Here is another description of the captured people returning to Freetown:  
“He explains how a captured ship on his way to South America, full of slaves, was unloaded at the harbor in Freetown.  
“And what kind of ships are there at anchor? They were brought in by the cruisers and condemned by the court. All slaves should now be set on land. Thousands of earlier freed slaves have gathered in the hope of finding among the newcomers a friend or brother, a mother or sister, from whose side they had once been taken. A loud shout of joy sounds as the boats approach the shores. But they go too slowly for many, they cannot hold back the longing of love. Many of them swim from the land towards the boats; others jump out of the boats into the sea; greetings and embraces, above the depths of the ocean. As soon as the boats touch the land, the individual groups mix together so lively, that it resembles a handful of fighting troops, rather than the reunion of long-separated friends. Soon, groups of different nations and tribes have been formed. One gathers around more respected persons, who tell their people of the misery, the amazement and joy, from the condition of the tribe at home, the well-being of friends, the fate of the enemies.”

Speaks of all the wealth and useful things his family received from Netzerk the Seal. "Truly he is our greatest friend, and we would die without him."

"I remember playing near my mother as she worked, and I remember hearing her soft voice as she sang. These memories are very clear to me, for it was I who helped with the tent raising, and thus obeyed the wishes of my father. And my mother sang, thusly:"

I am but a small woman. And my breath blows a song as I toil willingly. I am willing and happy to work, and in my eagerness to be of use, I sew with this needle. Sharp is this needle, like the tooth of a fox. I am but a small woman, and my thoughts make a poem. As I toil willingly. I am willing and happy to work. And in my eagerness to please you, to make this garment, I sew with my needle, and cut with this sharp knife. And the knife is sharp, like the bite of a wolf.

These mittens I have made, for the hands of one who protects me. I will sing a song. A little song about someone who stands willingly at the blow holes. There is joy in knowing that the garments I have made, unworthy as they are, will be a comfort to a hunter.

The cold wind strives in vain against his garments, the garments that I made so craftily. I am but a small woman, but I toil willingly. I am eager to be of use to him, who stands patiently at the blowholes.

"My father is gone now. No longer does he stand patiently at the blow holes. And my mother is but a memory."

It was my father who taught me the secrets of netserk. Vid Netserk is a creature of silence. He can hear a flea jump from the back of a dog. The dogs can smell the seal through the ice, and tell the hunter where the blowhole is.

### Witch - Moira O'Connor
PIC (original B&W PIC)  
Tier 4  
Ability: durable, tough, collocutor, convincing Diff 5  
Skills: Swim, weave, sew, farm, fish, smoking, boldness, reading a person  
Languages: Gaelic (Irish), English, Latin, Hebrew (written only)

An Irish Catholic 26 (seeming) year old woman. Born in Lismore, Ireland, as a young girl she learned witchcraft from her mother and boosted her potion skills by studying the work of Robert Boyle, the founder of modern chemistry.

Moira lost her husband and two sons to Typhus. Without a husband she ran out of money and gradually lost all her possessions. She lost her house when the lord of Lismore Castle, the Scotsman George St. James, wanted her property by the river for a factory.

Both the Duke of Wellington and Lord Castlereagh were born in 1769. Both fondly recall being raised by Moira as their governess: Wellington at Dangan castle, and Castlereagh in Dublin.

Moira emigrated to London to avoid debtor's prison. She worked a fishing boat from Wexford Ireland to Cardigan to cross the sea, a rather unlady-like act, but she is fierce, proud and resourceful.

#### Background
Educated - Moira was identified by the proctors at Lismore Abbey School from a young age as a different kind of student. She was always trouble in class, so they sentenced her to quiet time in the library. While there, which was most of her young life, she reads books collected by the 1600's chemist Robert Boyle:  
* The Book of Lismore (which she discovered behind a stone in a blocked-up doorway  
* The Sean-Teist (Old Testament), written in Latin, Hebrew and Irish  
* Erasmus' "On Free Will" in the original Latin, the response to Luther's protests  
* The Skeptical Chymist by Boyle himself

Transcriber - When her discovery of the Book of Lismore was, in turn, discovered by the proctor Micheál Óg Ó Longáin, he set her to transcribing it from Gaelic to English and also into Latin. In 1817 he will take credit for these translations.

#### Skills
Smoker - Moira smokes a clay pipe, which she keeps in her pocket, when she can find tobacco.  
Languages - English, Irish/Gaelic, Latin, Hebrew, French  
Literate - Moira can read, write and is an excellent translator/transcriber  
Historian - She specifically understands Charlemagne, the history of the Lombards,

#### Abilities
Disruptor - Moira wears an amber necklace, and carries a small bit of wool. When rubbed, static builds and can be used to disrupt a spirit.

Collocutor - Moira can start a conversation with anyone, and keep it going for a few minutes, asking them probing questions they are happy to answer. She can delay the onset of hostilities if she rolls well. The charm will wear off, but they will tend to think more highly of her after.

Convincing - When you make a deal with Moira, it usually seems like a really great bargain. Only ten minutes later might you realize that she was the main beneficiary.

Broomstick - Moira can fly on a broomstick, but she seldom has need. She can take up to one rider along with her. If it is "her" broomstick this costs her little. Temporarily enchanting any other broomstick takes a lot out of her.

Smokescreen - While smoking, Moira can, without one noticing until it is too late, generate a large volume of smoke obscuring sight, suitable for escape or diversion.

Plentiful Pot - When cooking in a specially prepared stew pot, over an open flame, Moira can cause food for one to two to feed about four to eight people. A gallon of clean water must be added. The food is delicious and healthy. Leftovers can not be stored. Anyone consuming this food has disadvantage on any rolls vs Moira that day.

Brewer - Moira can make potions, given time, ingredients and cooking technology, that include the effects of mental influence, such as temporary feelings of affection, confusion, and the like. These only work if taken voluntarily (even if they don't know what it does), typically from Moira's own hand or the hand of a friend.
