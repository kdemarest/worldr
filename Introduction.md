# Rule Britannia - Introduction

*What unseen forces shape the destinies of men and cast the very planets 'neath their sinister will?*

**The date is June 12, 1817\.**

*Note: This campaign **seeks to tread new ground**. Despite the date, it is emphatically **not** steampunk. Its hidden theme is for only the GM to know, and the players to discover.*

<<Need the one sentence summary of how the campaign FEELS here>>

The life of British citizens in 1817 is ordinary, and soon to be utterly extinguished.

Below the mundane facade, perilous forces stir. Sinister powers over mind and spirit rise, and all the strength of empire can not stem the tide.

Who will see the threat? What heroic citizens of the Empire will rise to the challenge?

## Setting

The British Empire, regarded by its citizens as the apex of civilization, spans the globe, driven by supremacy of the sea, bugeoning colonialism, and a nascent industrial revolution. This is the origin and civilized center of our player characters.

For them, hope flowers! The 23 year Napoleonic war ends. Technological marvels abound. Wealth pours in from abroad. The empire will soon govern one quarter of the humans on earth.

And yet...

Britain is troubled at home.

This year, summer never came. Crops withered in the fields, and the proud British population is getting desperate.

The king is wracked by bouts of madness. His heir is an unserious fop. The crowd's darling, Princess Caroline, has died in childbirth.

Jacobites and Luddites sabotage both government and industry.  Bonapartist threats cross the channel.

Pestilence wracks Ireland. Cholera sweeps the newly acquired Indian colonies, and "plague ships" are burned in the harbor of London with all aboard.

Many thousands of soldiers and sailors, newly released after the Napoleonic wars, destabilize the streets of London.


This is the world our players enter. To them, the grandeur of the empire, and the troubles that beset it are merely as they appear. Nothing more.

But before the end everything they know will be re-cast in a revealing, eons-spanning, mind twisting light, and they themselves will be transformed in ways none of them yet imagine. Some for the better... but not all.

What Kind of World is Rule Britannia?

Set on earth in 1817 the world is roughly as history describes. To the average person history will *seem* to remain unchanged, but behind the scenes players will confront a baffling and sinister force whose true ends they must discover.

Important components of the world include:

**Spirits are real**

* Present in all things, spirits linger, quests unfulfilled, in haunted places or unseen on the streets. Some few men are born attuned to this grim reality.

**Technology is transforming understanding**

* The first vaccine, the steam locomotive, gas streetlamps and copper clad Baltimore Clippers change lives in ways few expect.

**Intrigue Abounds**

* Spies and plots whirl throughout Europe - Bonapartists, royalists, slavers, Luddites, Irish revolutionaries, Chinese secret societies, and more

**Ancient Cultures hold deep mysteries**

* Primitive yet powerful nations still thrive. From Africa's Gold Coast, to the arctic, to distant sweltering Java, the British colonizers face deep unknowns.

**Social Order is Fragile**

* The world is a wild, untamed place. London has no formal police force. Bold, courageous men can still achieve much. Or lose it all.

# The Player Characters

The core premise of the player characters is that they are staunch members of the British Empire during its ascent. They know their own superiority. They believe the British way is the civilized way.

Some players might choose non-British origins, but the campaign works best when some degree of colonial, empire-building hubris is at play. If somebody isn't suggesting tea after the party gets swarmed but supernatural rats, then the spirit of the campaign is missing.

# GM Knowledge

What is the big secret?

**A Dark Influence Lurks**

* Behind it all a corrupting force manipulates men as a spider trims a web, setting civilization against itself, bending events to unravel sentient humanity

## The Spirit of the Campaign

Early in the game, and from time to time, make sure there is plenty of "normal life" to act as contrast for the following:

* Discovery of wondrous, unsuspected places  
* The slow unravelling of tantalizing mysteries  
* Sudden blows of memorable horror

## Pacing

There are many mysteries and clues to unravel, many places to explore, people and entities to meet. Let the core element come to light slowly. Boil the frog.
