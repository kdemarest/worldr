# Masked Items
Because the BTs must remain a secret organization, many items carry a charm to camouflage themselves. Detecting camouflage, usually a voluntary and not a passive action, is a roll at the wielder's tier vs the capabilities of the potential viewer.

# Ooron
Raw: PIC  
Module: PIC  
Powers lots of stuff, but it can't directly harm anything with a soul inside it.

# Cane Sword
PIC  
A gentleman's cane with a screw-off tip that is also a short sword (dmg 3). In addition, the handle holds three tips suitable for fashioning a spear or atl atl arrows (the cane acting as the atl atl) along with cat gut for affixing them. The handle is a skeletal claw gripping the sign against the evil eye. Holding this up against evil gives a +1 asset to resist whatever influence (overthrow, blinding, etc).

# Congreve Rocket
PIC LINK  
Range of 1000 yards  
A tube of soft hammered iron about 8 inches long and 2 inches in diameter, strapped to a shaft of bamboo about 4 ft long. Re-usable if you have gunpowder and a fuse. Tends to set an area of fire where it lands, exploding ammuniton for example.

# Curtana
PIC  
A sword used to crown British royalty, this sword has a squared off tip symbolizing mercy. The sword only can harm the overthrown, giving them a new saving throw each time a blow is struck. Damage is 5.

# Flintlock Pistol
Range:
- 8m is "long" at -1
- 4m and below is "normal" at -0

Reload takes 5 rounds (20 seconds)

In damp conditions 30% misfire (1 hindrance)  
In regular conditions 10% misfire

# Golden Legend Incunabulum
This book contains the text of the Golden Legend about the lives of saints. It was one of the most popular 15th century books in Europe. It is written in simple latin, one of the first incunabula. It grants an asset vs religion and folklore, and an additional asset if the topic is European, Saints or Festivals.

# Badge of the Order of the Thistle
PIC  
The insignia is Latin: "nemo me impune lacessit" which means "No one provokes me with impunity." When chosen, upon the first strike against the wearer, the striker suffers a mishap as if they had rolled a 1. The actual roll functions like normal.

# Coin of Edward the Confessor
PIC both sides  
When this coin is held under the tongue, two things happen:
1. A "mild" dark spirits curse may be gradually relieved over about ten minutes, expending the artifact for a "few days".
2. Holding an coin under the tongue grants +1 vs mental possession. Instead, the character may experience a surreal dream, but not be overthrown and attack their companions.

The coin's actual lettering, on the front, is "EDPERD REX", while the back reads

Interpreting the symbols on the coin is difficult:
- When one writes down the shape of the characters, when you check those shapes against what you have written, they do not appear to be the same.
- When one shows the coin to another person not involved at the moment in the crypt, they see no writing, just etching on the coin.
- If you ask another person to write the contents of the coin, they will refuse adamantly with many excuses. If threatened and forced, they apparently see the head in the middle as covering the whole coin.

# Crystal Ball of Snooping
The spirit of this ball is unpredictable. It will wander about, listening in on conversations. Anything it finds interesting it will show as images within the ball to whomever should choose to look. The spirit will have opinions about people, and what to show to whom. Spending time to attune to the ball grants better readings.

# Edward's Regalia
This coronation regalia, left by Edward the Confessor, was supposed destroyed by Oliver Cromwell in 1649. When worn they provide protection from overthrow, and even can clarify the mind of an overthrown temporarily. It consists of very simple bronze implements threaded with red gold
- a simple circlet (grants a daily reroll against overthrow)
- a rod (temp cures overthrow, one person per day)
- a ring which, dropped in a basin of pure water, will cure blindness

# Emerald Tablet
Prime book of the Hermetics.

Truth! Certainty! That in which there is no doubt!  
That which is above is from that which is below, and that which is below is from that which is above,  
working the miracles of one [thing]. As all things were from One.  
Its father is the Sun and its mother the Moon.  
The Earth carried it in her belly, and the Wind nourished it in her belly,  
as Earth which shall become Fire.  
Feed the Earth from that which is subtle,  
with the greatest power. It ascends from the earth to the heaven  
and becomes ruler over that which is above and that which is below.

# Gregorian Band
In Bolton's ring is Pope Gregory the Great, originally known as "Gregorius Anicius".
- Gives +4 vs Intention Shield, because Gregorius created the Benedictines, whose intent has deceived the papacy and the Corruptor for centuries.
- Give +2 generally vs spirit attack

# Hermetic Stone
Imbues the holder with the following:
- Immune to fire
- Immune to infection, rot and corruption
- No need to eat
- No evil creature may approach 10' (but the holder may approach)
- It is immune to gravity itself and will stay in any place it is released
- Constant heavenly odors
- See all spirits
- Dream revelatory dreams

# Hornbook
PIC  
A reading teaching aid common in the 18th and early 19th centuries

# Khbekhnet's Ushabtis
This set of ushabtis - a house and three women.

# Intaglio of Caracalla
PIC  
Contains a Spirit of a former roman slave. This spirit can be Artifact Tethered.  
This engraving in amethyst depicts Caracalla, a Roman emperor likened to Louis XVI (who was executed 25 years prior in the French Revolution). Caracalla:
- Has his brother murdered by praetorian guards
- Granted citizenship to all free Roman men
- Known for the Baths of Caracalla, where amazing statuary was recovered. Golems.

# Magnifying Glass of Roger Bacon
Using this hand-held magnifier, one can take torch light and focus it so precisely that it burns an enemy, or sears through a distant rope, or momentarily blinds.

# Moon Mask
(pic)  
The wearer of this mask gains magical power, but the mask can not be removed without a concerted pool spend of  
+6 pool, +1 edge

# Moon Stone
Per Isaac Newton LINK
- Emits light equal to a full moon upon desire, over a great area if needed.
- It weeps an oil which, if a drop is laid upon a person and not removed, it will numb them within a minute, and freeze their bodily liquids within the hour bringing death.
- Held in the hand the stone brings hopelessness and apathy to all endeavor.

# Ring of St. Benedict
PIC  
One can wear this ring on a pinky, and it does nothing in particular. It's true use is that when you look through it, twisting it counter-clockwise slowly, and the ring's top is aligned to the goodness or evilness (straight up or down respectively), and the mind is calmed, one can see hidden signs and sigils, and the essence of magical effects, left by enchanters of power, whether of the corruptor or the Benedictines. One only gets a glimpse of them, at the moment that the ring is aligned, so you get about 2 words per turn. The ring must be continuously turned to work.

# Royal Ring
Grants a +1 against all mental attacks, and a +2 if the wearer has British royal blood. Upon command, it may grant the Royal Boon for three minutes: a +4 vs mental attack and invisibility to all overthrown.

It was almost discovered at Sheerness, where the unrecognized King was roughly handled by fishermen who attempted to rob him. With great coolness the King produced a toothpick case and some other valueless trifles from his pockets, and the men were content to take these without searching him further. By this means the Ring was preserved and descended to the Cardinal of York, the last of the Stuarts. On his death in 1807 the Ring and a Badge of the Order of the Thistle were returned by his Executor to King George III.

# Saint Benedict Medal
A golden medal (details) which, when placed upon the dead, protects them from possession and can cause them to speak of what killed them. It also draws the soul from the body, whence it may travel its normal path.

# Seeing Stone
The bearer may gaze into it and see any friend they desire, but there is a long buffer time to send a spirit to travel to that friend, and return with a mental vision of what was.

# Staff of Benedict
Disguised as a Christain staff, the cross adorning it allowed Benedict to travel with the staff without arousing suspicion of his wizardry. When brandished, all who intend ill of the wielder must step back and may not approach. In latin are the words "Vade retro satana" (step back evil). Each round after the first, an opposed check is made to see if the ban is weakened.

# Silver Blood Stone
PIC SILVER, PIC RED  
This silvery stone is strangely reflective. It has no powers in its silver state, but, when a dark mage invokes magic, the trapped spirit in the stone turns it blood red, mottled color. The mage can choose one of the following:
1. Gain an asset. Recharge in 1 day.
2. Gain a re-roll. Stone splits and bleeds, destroying the spirit.

# Warding Heart (aka spirit gate)
A Warding Heart is a large 3" diamond containing a black hole about a centimeter around. It sparkles with a surreal light, as molecules of diamond slowly disintegrate by fusion. Warding Hearts are a deep connection between the spirit realm and the material world. One exists at the heart of each Ward on Jupiter.

King David is the metaphorical name of a human king who found one of the Warding Hearts and wore it, giving him great power over spirits. It is said that each is a gate to the spirit world, but none now live who know the secret of such travel.

# Black Relics
See Black Skull.

## Disposal
The pieces and any gems must be ground into dust and mixed with a diamond that has lain in the light of both a full week of sun and a full moon. The metal must be melted down and the dust stirred in. The resulting slag will be a raw magical artifact ready to be shaped into something new.
