* Wood Ear [LINK](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auricularia_auricula-judae) \- these flex a bit on their tree to follow nearby speech or movement. If you eat one whole you can hear what it heard within 20 minutes.  
* Curvularia [LINK](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curvularia) \- Black mold fungus. A heat symbiote, smearing it on you and letting it root in skin (takes about an hour) confers heat resistance to about 900 degrees.  
* Phaseolina fungus [LINK](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macrophomina_phaseolina) \- little goopy black balls. Once on you it travels to your food,  covers it and spoils it. Also consume human hair, making it patchy and gross looking. Will cover eyes, but can be washed out.  
* Mushroom Termitomyces Titanicus [LINK](https://www.forestfloornarrative.com/blog/2018/2/16/fungi-friday-termitomyces-titanicus) \- Enormous mushroom farmed by termites, sprouts from termite mound. Termites will eat all your wood objects.
