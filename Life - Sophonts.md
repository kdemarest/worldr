**Humans** - You know who they are  
**Austra** - Ultra-pacifistic simians with a pure focus on the good of the community. They suicide rather than suffer slavery, to make capturing other Austra pointless.
**Moai** - Stony Jovian natives, not bright, but strong and spiritual. Enslaved by Corruptor.  
**Zocto** - Eight armed Europans. Those who migrated to Jupiter are muscled, the very few who remain on Europa are spindly  
**Ioans** - Fiery race originally from Jupiter's moon Io, now bonded to the Corruptor  
**Zayans** - Simian species who evolved before humans, likely extinct after their automatons revolted due to Corruptor influence  
**Venusians** - a spindly insectoid species with superior "controllers" and feral drones. Baked Venus in environmental catastrophe. Now dependant on Corrupt genetech to survive. Enslaved.   
**Purifex** - overwhelming mega species cleansing the universe  
**Mariners** - Self-devolved cyber-integrated orca-like megacivilization that created earth and were ultimately defeated by the Purifex
