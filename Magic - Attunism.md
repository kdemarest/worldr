# Attunism

Spirits: co-aligned

Creates a **long-term bond** by tethering the **spirit of an item** with which you have close confederacy. Attunism can also be used within your **lair**, giving special capabilities there. For example, a Captain might always know when his ship is damaged, a Navigator if his sextant was touched. A soldier might hear from his dagger where to stab an enemy.

Casting:  
The item must be special to the mage. After taking Attunism as a school the mage gets one attuned item. Each additional attunement costs 1/3/5/7/9 Int allocation.

Abilities:

**T1 Spirit Bond (e)** - You bond with the spirit of an object or place, and get basic information about it: whether it still exists, is damaged, is repaired, and the general direction to the spirit. Bonding requires 24 hours.

**T2 Buddy Spirit (i3)** - You temporarily attune to the spirit of a willing person, gaining knowledge about them similar to the spirit bonds above. This is a light-weight bond which other bonding magic can not leverage.  

**T2 Spirit Bond - Knowledge (e)** - A previous spirit bond now allows you to sense the nature of whomever is touching the item. If you touch the bonded spirit, you learn who might have been interacting with the object.  

**T3 Spirit Bond - Service (e)** - You may ask a bonded spirit to do things, like a ship sailing, house opening doors, or a ring slipping from a finger. Opposing a creature or sentient requires a successful attack roll.  

**T3 Spirit Bond - Call (i3)** - Call a human-carryable bonded spirit's object to your hand within Long range. The object must move through space as the manifest spirit pushes it, it does not teleport. If held by another you must make a successful attack.  

**T4 Spirit Bond - Viewing (i4)** - You can see through a bonded spirit's eyes, improving your ability to ask it to do things. Range is short and duration is 1 minute. Each additional int spent improves range or duration.  

**T4 Spirit Bond - Kinesis (i2)** - You may cause a bonded spirit's object of 15lbs or less to fly through the air as you direct for one minute.  

**T5 Bonded Converse (e)** - When within vocal range you may converse with your bonded spirit at will.
