# Companionism

A Companionist is a light mage (also called a medium) who seeks to befriend spirits. They have the easiest time tethering, and often use spirit telepathy to overcome language barriers.

## Spirit Qualities

The important qualities of a spirit, for companionist purposes, include

* The spirit's tier. For spirits this is also how many metaphorical hits they can take.  
* Language  
* Key life experiences  
* Key knowledge acquired during life  
* Key skill set due to former profession or background

## Spirit Opposition

When a companionist mage confronts a spirit, some possible outcomes (in order of power) include:

1. **Abate**		the spirit stops its function for one round, but it resumes the next  
2. **Abjure**		the spirit loses grasp and return to its mage  
3. **Vanquish**	the spirit halts activity and becomes inactive to the mage  
4. **Liberate**	the spirit is unshackled  
5. **Convert**	the spirit unshackles and becomes tethered

## Abilities

A companionist mage can acquire abilities such as the following. For Watch, Guard, and Resist only a single spirit can be assigned to a single target (including the mage) at a time.

**Observe** - relay perceptions of the material world, from any distance. The spirit must travel to the destination first. It may also wait and act as an alarm. Spirit perceptions are filtered through how spirits see the world.

**Share Knowledge** - the mage may ask the spirit for knowledge it possessed while it was alive. Roll DC depends on the importance and obscurity of the knowledge.

**Share Skill** - the mage may channel a key skill possessed by the spirit while it was alive, typically granting an asset or, sometimes as a special effect, temporarily acquiring the skill.

**Watch** - A spirit watches over a target, conveying what they perceive to the mage. Roll to detect incoming curses, degenerism, or attempts at possession. The spirit might granting the target a bonus according to the spirit's key life experiences.

**Guard** - A guard spirit defends a victim against possession by a dark spirit. Roll Liberated Mind each round. If the roll fails the mage may choose: either the victim is now possessed (requiring exorcism), or the spirit may suffer 1 hit. A special effect may abjure or vanquish the spirit.

**Resist** - engage a spirit to abate a curse or stall degeneration. Roll each round. Success abates the curse that round.  A special effect may abjure or vanquish the spirit. Or give a +2 to whomever they are guarding.

**Redirect** - free floating spirits may be directed into a Hedron. Roll vs the tier of any opposition attempting to direct the spirits elsewhere, adjusted by the friendliness of the spirits.

**Vanquish** - the mage may take an action in concert with a spirit that is Watching, Guarding or Resisting to Vanquish the opposing spirit. Spend an int then roll vs tier. Gain up to two assets for each +1 int spent.

**Liberate** - the mage may take an action in concert with a spirit that is Watching, Guarding or Resisting to Vanquish the opposing spirit. Spend an int then roll vs tier. Gain up to two assets for each +1 int spent. Failure causes the mage int damage equal to the tier of the spirit being liberated.

Thoughts on Henton's Spirits

**Felix:** +1 to Liberate a shackled spirit. He aids persuasion and empathy because he knows what it is to be a slave. He can communicate with other spirits.

**Bean**: +1 to Guard a target. He trained for seventeen years to combat subjugation by the 5th Ward, so this is familiar territory for him.

**Zira**: +1 to assist Liberated Mind on a Watched target, because of her rigorous scientific mental discipline. She will also know when the target
