# Cursism

Souls: Dark only

Force a spirit to plague the living, or haunt a location.

Curses can be inflicted by overthrown people, dark mages, dark creatures, objects or locations. A shackled spirit is used to enact the curse. Victims must have the curse removed, or in the case of objects or locations the spirit must be untethered from it. Cursed objects sometimes mend themselves, or magically appear back on your person.

NOTES: Curses often activate when the victom rolls a natural 1. One curse widens the victim's critical fail range.

## Casting
Creating a curse requires rolling an attack, then binding 1 point of your Int pool to the curse, until removal. The curse is an order to a spirit of generally no more than one to three words.

## Removing
A curse is ongoing until the mage declares it halted, or the curse is removed. If the spirit is malicious it might stay, so even the caster might need Effort to remove their own curse. Death of the mage halts the curse. Learning and using the spirit's name Eases the difficulty.

## Effects
See Spectrism for details.
