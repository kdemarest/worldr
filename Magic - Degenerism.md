# Degenerism

The mage regresses entities back to a prototype of their evolution, growth, or construction. This school also encapsulates the twisting of sentients into a mix with another (animal) species. For example:

* T1 - Cause a candle to be restored (unburned)  
* T2 - Revert a man to an ape for a moment. Longer at higher tiers, and permanently at T6.
* T3 - Change a satiated person back to hungry or even starving
* T4 - Mix men and bats to create awful demon-like creatures  
* T4 - Blend men with birds. Such things are always morose, pathetic, and disease-ridden  
* T5 - Change woven cotton to cotton blooms  
* T6 - Change a sword into the ore it was made from
