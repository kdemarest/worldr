# Dominism

Magic: Dark
Resistance: Liberated Mind

The mage projects an enslaved spirit, or their own spirit, into the mortal coil of another, achieving various objectives. The target typically feels like "something is pushing against their mind, trying to enter it."

Those without magical defenses get no roll and are simply overcome with the appropriate effect. Magical defenses give the opportunity to resist as described below.

**Dwelling** - Inserts a spy spirit into a target's mind. The spirit can perceive everything the victim perceives, though relaying such information is not automatic. A sufficiently skilled Dwelling attack goes unnoticed if the resistance roll fails.

**Invasion** - A form of quick mental intrusion in which a spirit enters the mind of and possesses a target, enabling Control as detailed below. Requires a single round, instant attack.After invasion a victim with Liberated Mind may roll every turn to throw off the invader. Victims without Liberated Mind will stay invaded at the attacker's whim.

**Grumbling** - A so-called grumbler can plague a victim with distractions of noise and voices. This creates hindrance 1 due to sleeplessness and distraction. Victims will doubt your sanity. Over a course of days they will doubt their friends, eventually construing every action in the worst light. It can lead towards Possession.

Immediately:			suffer 1 hindrance while the grumbler is actively gumbling  
After first sleepless night: 	suffer 1 hindrance at all times  
After third sleepless night:	suffer 2 hindrance at all times  
After a week:			lose 1 edge

**Possession** - This slow siege of the mind wears the victim down, making them hear voices and experience brief (non-game-effecting) hallucinations until their will is eroded. Grumbling (see above) is one common method. For each week under seige, the victim gains 1 hindrance against the possession, and against the exercise of control.

Once possessed the victim co-habits their own mind with the possessing spirit. After successful possession the victim may or may not continue to hear grumbling.

**Control** - A possessing spirit may attempt to control the victim. Note that the _victim_ chooses whether to spend Effort on any action taken while under Control.

Victims with Liberated Mind may roll to resist, with appropriate assets if the action goes against the victim's ethos. Victims without defenses may only resist strong antithetical actions (eg attacking a PC they are loyal to) and generally gain no assets.

Examples of Control include failure to act, disable spending effort, put away weapon, hand an object to an enemy, walk instead of run, collapse, close your own eyes, look away or towards.
