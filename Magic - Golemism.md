# Golemism

Souls: Dark Only

The mage injects a soul into an inanimate object specially prepared to be a golem. Golems take independent action, and feel that they are exercising free will. But a golem is never truly free of the influence of their creator, and will convince themselves of anything their creator desires. Though sometimes cunning, golems are seldom smart.

## **Creating** {#creating}

Reserve 3 Int points per Tier of the golem created.

Making a golem has two parts. First, you must put the thing together in a form that resembles a live being. For this reason many prefer simple clay or wax because it is easy to shape. Second, the golem must be powered, as follows, by:

1. A certain dark blue crystal heart\
2a. A soul tethered or shackled, of a tier matching that of the golem.  
2b. Or the mage's soul, possessing the golem and causing the mage's body to collapse.

temporary possession (clumsy, roll disadvantage) vs permanent possession

Although a soul may enter a golem willingly (tethering) that soul never again has truly free will, thus making all golem creation a dark act.

## **Killing** {#killing}

A golem acts like a malicious robot. Golems can be stopped by removing their blue crystal heart.

Every golem has immunities and weaknesses, plus one Undoing that is its particular weakness. Examples of Undoings might be:

* Reading the golem's name which is written on its forehead  
* Splashing it with water or fire  
* Never looking at it (thus it can not move)  
* Being confronted by its true nature, or someone it loves, etc.

## Golem Plants

If a Golemist also has Naturalism, then sentient souls can be prompted to manipulate plants so that they become active, or even inserted into plants to "wake them up."
