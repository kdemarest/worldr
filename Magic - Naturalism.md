# Naturalism

Souls: n/a

This includes everything natural: plants, herbs, mushrooms, animals all can be made "more" than they are. Mushrooms acquire amazing effects. Animals can be trained into many tricks. Speaking with animals and plants. Etc.

Specifically this involved perceiving and communicating with the meta-spirits of species (eg the Spirit of All Terns). This is generally accessible in non-sophont species, and becomes more noticeable in sophont species when a high percentage of extant members are proximate, eg millions of humans or the few Mariners.

Creating: Naturalism requires the collecting and preparation of ingredients into appropriate forms: potions, injections, salves, inhaled dust, etc. Such preparation typically gives 1 Ease to the use of the form. The mage is connecting with the Master Soul of all plants of that variety.

Using: The form will dictate the usage: injecting, tossing, smearing or drinking. Note that non-biologicals are immune to all naturalism, and some biologicals will be immune to a form of delivery. For example, an entity that doesn't breathe is immune to inhaled dust.
