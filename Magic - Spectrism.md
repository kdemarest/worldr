# Spectrism

Souls: Light or Dark

Casting: Call upon a spirit to take an action, typically with a minor manifestation into the material world.

Effects: The kinds of things one can ask for are listed below. Some of these actions require the spirit to *strong manifest*, which tires a spirit out.

**Light or Dark Effects**

- **Move** a small, light object from one place to another  
- **Enshroud** a small object temporarily, explainable by overlooking or misplacing it  
- **Whisper** in an ear, explainable as "just hearing things"  
- **Distract** with noise or motion, usually by rattling something  
- **Unsettle** somebody with whispers or if the situation is already scary, **frighten**  
- **Queasy** like being kicked in the privates or punched in the gut, like an illness  
- **Deafen** somewhat, like a person putting a finger in your ear  
- **Misstep** or **Trip** to cause injury, as if clumsy  
- **Sudden Chills**  
- **Obstruct** a person's actions (-1 hinder), explainable through clumsiness  
- **Deliver** a substance created by Naturalism (the PC makes attack/damage rolls)  
- **Deliver** a cypher effect that is intended to be used on others

**Dark Effects**

- **Animate\*** its own bones with ease \- but not the bones of others; still child strength  
- **Vomit\*** like a manifest finger down the throat, explainable as illness  
- **Suffocate\*** somewhat, by covering the mouth and nose  
- **Dim Sight** limiting vision distance to 10'  
- **Blind\*** by poking the eye or obstructing vision for one round  
- **Indefinite Madness\*** per [this source](http://dndspeak.com/2020/06/100-indefinite-madnesses/)  
- **Infirm heart\*** \- keel over or stagger as heart flutters  
- **Numb hands\*** \- drop held objects. Hindrance after some rubbing.  
- **Locked jaw**\* \- you may not speak nor put anything in your mouth.  
- **Swollen joints\*** \- speed edge reduced by 1

Items marked with \* are generally evil and will upset a spirit.
