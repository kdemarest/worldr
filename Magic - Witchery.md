# Witchery

Souls: Light or Dark
Restriction: Female only

See the Faction: Witches for details.

Casting: Typically the weaving of spirit thread more than the direct manipulation of tethered spirits, though that can happen in a limited way. Black Witches can shackle spirits, but all witches typically tether or shackle at half their tier.

Witch magic operates at full tier, and if the power is malign, the witch may roll with advantage.

Witches always roll with advantage during a full moon, and may never roll with advantage during a new moon.

## Common Powers

Witchery often involves changing minds and influencing health. Witches have specialty dark (gray) magic that risks being used for evil, but when so used has knowable consequences (as opposed to the First Ward inflicting unknowable horrors upon them):


* Communicate one to another in dreams, regardless of distance, but not entirely under voluntary control. Such communication often happens when the need is great.

* SEP fields and minor reality alteration  

* Destroying a nemesis with needles, wool and straw. The nemesis must have hurt someone they loved.

* Creating and using a sympathy doll (voodoo doll) to cause pains or health issues.

* Persuasion - When the speech of a witch is for the purpose of foiling the corrupt, they are extremely charming and persuasive, gaining advantage on rolls.

* Bargains - Witches are charming when making a bargain. They typically get their way, and also typically come out with the best part of the deal. The other party gets a bad taste in their mouth about the deal about a day later. THe kickback of a bargain has gotten many witches killed.

* Aerial Power - Witches may ride broomsticks great distances, though it costs them to do so. They can even carry a passenger, in a pinch, but not very far.

* No Compulsion - No witch may be compelled to do something they do not want. The witch will die before that happens. If forced, they will attempt a bargain.

* Beauty - For brief periods (long enough to seduce a man or another woman) a witch may transform her physical self to be younger and more beautiful.

* Brewing - Most witches can create concoctions and poultices that exert
	- mental influence, such as temporary feelings of affection, confusion, and the like.
	- health influences, such as sickening or wasting away
	- These only work if taken voluntarily (even if the victim doesn't know what it does), typically from the witch's own hand or the hand of a trusted friend. 

* Travel Between - A witch with permission may travel the Between Lands of an individual. They are astute at crossing vast lands Between to find any Black Marks, though it takes time and does not always succeed.

* Disrupt a spirit  

* Convince someone to enter into a bargain that mainly benefits the witch  

* While smoking subtly make a smokescreen for hiding or diversion  

* Plentiful Pot that can cause food for a few to feed many  

* Sacrificing ones' pool points to give to another, one for one

The medium through which a witches' power manifests differs greatly by culture, and includes significant variation. For exampke:

* Ekua through little carved or woven naturalistic totems  
* Moira through blarney  
* Meriwa through string figure weaving   
* Mariso through tattoos and face painting  
* Lavinia through tarot
