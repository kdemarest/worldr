# Overview

The nature of magic is quite different from other rule systems. THe nature of magic is as follows:

### _Spirits are real_
Every living creature has a "Spirit" which exists ethereally within the world. Sentient creatures also have a "soul", which is unknowable.

### _All magic is the action of spirits_
All supernatural effects MUST be catalyzed by a spirit, and never anything else. If a mage wants to cause a magical effect, he must either persuade or force a spirit to do it.

### _Magic does not directly damage health_
Instead, it typically inflicts conditions or acts as a tool. Magical harm is limited to 1 point. Magic can, however, hinder things like edge, or weaken a foe such that they suffer greater harm. Magic never strenthens the damage an entity inflicts.

### _Magic is a Corrupt Secret_

Openly sharing magical knowledge is typically a [Corrupt Secret](Corrupt%20Secrets.md), bringing woe to speaker and listener alike.

### _Magic is mysterious and unpredictable_

Like human nature, magic can never be entirely predicted. It remains mysterious, hidden, inscrutable. If a character's magic is reliably having the exact same effect over and over something needs to change.


# Magery

When a character becomes a mage, they gain:

* Ability:		T1 Sense Spirit  
* Ability:		T1 Connect Spirit  
* Skill:		One Magic Type (see below)

When a mage causes a spirit to take an action, it does so at the tier of the mage, and using any Effort the mage might choose to deploy.

### **Ability: Sense Spirit** {#ability:-sense-spirit}

You passively sense untethered co-aligned spirits and spirits you have tethered. A spirit is often a kind of glow, or smell or taste. Dark spirits (including shackled spirits), are like an inky fog, black, with tendrils like ink.

Opposing Spirits: To see opposing spirits spend i1 to sense them for one minute (10 rounds)

Cloaked Spirits: If a mage has cloaked their spirits you must spend i1 and roll vs their tier to penetrate the cloak for one minute. You may retry the roll each round until you succeed.

### **Ability: Connect Spirit** {#ability:-connect-spirit}

Since all magic is mediated by spirits, a mage must somehow connect to one or more spirits to make magical effects. Light mages do this with the willing consent of the spirit(s), and likewise collaborate when requesting the spirit to perform tasks. Dark mages force a connection, and tyrannically order their spirits to act.

Due to this difference, light mages retain their spirits more easily, while dark mages can shackle more spirits but lose them more easily.

* A light mage may tether up to \<tier\> spirits, and keep that same number Active.  
* A dark mage may shackle up to 3x\<tier\> spirits and keep that same number Active.  
* Additional spirits may be brought into Hedrons and the like, but doing so does not assume a connection.  
* Spirits act at the tier of their mage. Effort by the mage channels through the spirit.

A connected spirit will:

* Produce magic as directed by the mage (see Magic Types below)  
* Travel with the mage, in a way the player may specify, but never in a manifest form.  
* Depart, each full moon**,** if the mage fails a new Tether roll

### Tethering

Light Mages connect to spirits by a voluntary process called Tethering. Most spirits are reluctant if not outright hostile to the idea of tethering, because once tethered they are strongly compelled to do as ordered and may not attempt to depart until the next full moon.

A mage may tether a number of spirits equal to their tier.

Here is the tethering process:

1. Find \- One must first find a spirit that is detectable. The GM will let you know if you find such spirits.  
2. Communicate \- You must speak with and convince a spirit to be bound, thus you must know its language or have some means of communication. Skill with the spirit's historical time period, region, social class or political faction can provide an asset.  
3. Serve \- Many spirits require a small (or large\!) act of charity, vengeance, etc from the mage, at the GM's discretion, and tethering might not be complete until such is done.  
4. Connect \- Spend 1 int and 1 minute to tether. Remember Witness Effect might apply. **Roll 6 \+ spiritTier \- mageTier** to tether

When a **spirit agrees**, you tether it (allocate 1 Int for as long as you have the spirit) and it is bound until you release it or a full moon arrives and it rebels.

### Shackling

Any mage can choose to force a connection to a spirit. This typically scars the mage's soul with darkness, resulting in a Black Mark. Dark mages often murder to obtain a specific spirit, and mystical preparations before a murder can yield a more powerful (but sometimes more temporary) spirit shackle.

## Research

Discovery comes in these tranches

1. Learn of the "Seven Secrets" (steps 2 and 3 below)  
2. Formless, Detectable, Listeners  
3. Tethering and Enslavement, Resisting, Blocking  
4. One Ability or Reagent or Writing. NOTE that learning the Dark Arts should happen through gameplay, and only after experiencing them for a while are the principles discovered.

### Lucius' Briefing {#lucius'-briefing}

Secret writings  
Two layers of Benedictines  
Deeper mission of the Benedictine order  
A scroll and a keybook to interpret the secret writings of Saint Benedict  
Research and learn to unlock various truths

### **Effects** {#effects}

1. **KNOWN** Witness Effect  
2. Circumstances  
3. Tethering abilities  
4. Communication brings woe: check the stars, the moon, the seasons, and the circumstances to ease the risk.

## **Writing** {#writing}

[Reference for Alchemical Symbols](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alchemical_Symbols_\(Unicode_block\))

Magic can be described in any language, but the special runes that express magic have unusual aspects:

1. Slippery: The shapes of the runes can not be held in the human consciousness. One may view them, but they squirm in the mind. Attempting to reproduce them invariably leads to a different shape. Comparing one shape to the next, however, will appear correct for most. Taking photos always improperly reproduces them, yet they always seem correct.  
2. Chronastrolib: The meaning of the shapes shifts according to the positions of astral bodies. The simplest ones are keyed to the sun. The more complex ones depend on the planets, constellations, and sometimes more subtle bodies like moons or comets.  
3. Ink Components  
4. Proper writing instruments  
5. Gibberish: Books are always written with much gibberish and obfuscation, because if the spirits (eg the corruptor) learns that it is disclosing magical truth the book will inevitably be destroyed in an "accident". The burning of the Library of Alexandria? Well, they had kept books of magical truths safe for hundreds of years, but when they were discovered...

## **\!Witness Effect** {#!witness-effect}

The Witness Effect makes magic perceived by others more difficult to complete. If there are multiple witnesses choose the worst single penalty applicable from the table below. Anyone who knows that magic is real is not a witness. The Difficulty adjusts as follows:

Penalty	Perception  
1h		Witness *suspects or is certain* magic is being done  
2h		Witness will see *unlikely* results  
3h		Witness will see *impossible* results

If the mage does not perceive a certain witness, the initial pool points are still spent. At that moment the effect of the unexpected witness will be felt (but not the location of the witness) and additional Effort may be chosen to overcome the Witness Effect.

If the **result** of the magic is only apparent many minutes or hours later, or the result is not detectable by the witness, then the result should not be considered, subject to GM discretion and interpretation. For example, some big magical effects might happen very quietly. That is, when a ship quietly enters a fog and comes out halfway across the world, there was no Witness at the time of casting.

## **\!Circumstances** {#!circumstances}

Extremely powerful mages or relics naturally amplify the nature of magic and loosen the bonds of physical law around them, with the following effects:

Magnification		\- Magic becomes more dramatic, overpowered, and uncontrolled.  
Loosening		\- Physical laws are impaired, making magic that violates them easier.  
Empowerment		\- Edge is granted to all nearby in Int, Might or Speed  
Infusion		\- Free floating Int pool exists, consumable by anyone with a roll

## **General Mage Abilities** {#general-mage-abilities}

**T1 Spirit Defense (e)** \- You are Trained when defending against any spirit you can sense. This can be taken a second time.

**T1 Trusted Medium (i1)** \- You gain an asset communicating with a chosen spirit. Enabler.

**T2 Spirit Hunter** (e) \- Trained in all skills finding, tracking and sensing spirits. Once per day may coax a dormant spirit awake for communication.

**T2 Read Spirit** (i2) \- For one minute you may discern a spirit's stats and purpose. Action.

**T3 Spirit Passive Defense (e)** \- You are Trained when defending against any spirit, whether you can sense the spirit or not.

**T4 Sensor (i4)** \- A spirit is the sensor

**T5 Call Dead Spirit** \- Per CSR, except the spirit conforms to this guide's limitations.

# **Spiritual Defenses** {#spiritual-defenses}

After sufficient experience with the ways of spirits, one can begin to acquire spiritual defenses to resist certain effects. These are listed below.

Entities who callously cause harm to life are more vulnerable to spiritual attack, by 1 or 2 hindrances. This follows the same theme as what brought the Corruptor into the world in the first place. When such hindrances accumulate the target "feels a door open", that is, the metaphorical door to the dark side of their own spirit.

## **Curatives** {#curatives}

Coins imbued with the good of a mage are the most common curative against magical effects. For example, a coin under the tongue will speed recovery from cursed blindness. It will ease the roll of an exorcist to eject a spirit from one possessed.

## **Defenses** {#defenses}

You must now buy a 5th thing, one of these, each tier. You can also spend your level skill to increase one of these by one level. First buy is Practiced, second is Trained, and third is Specialized.

#### Intention Shield \[IS\] {#intention-shield-[is]}

Skill granting 0, 1 or 2 on defense rolls when a spirit is watching your thoughts.

Resists mind reading, including anticipating the target's next move, being detected because of your mind, etc. 

#### Reality Discipline \[RD\] {#reality-discipline-[rd]}

Skill granting 0, 1 or 2 on rolls to perceive reality altered by spirits.

Using Reality Discipline to pierce the illusions of altered reality is line using a flashlight in a pitch black basement room. You only see what you explicitly tell the GM that you focus on.

You can focus on one thing per round, or spend **1 int** to persist the effect you for one minute (10 rounds). Once an altered reality is properly perceived you no longer have to roll, unless a mage alters reality again. You do perceive a ghostly image of what fooled people are seeing/experiencing.

#### Body Autonomy \[BA\] {#body-autonomy-[ba]}

Skill granting 0, 1 or 2 on defense rolls vs curses on your body.

You resist spirit tampering with the normal function of your body such as blindness, deafness, lock jaw, numb hands and the like.

#### Liberated Mind \[LM\] {#liberated-mind-[lm]}

Skill granting 0, 1 or 2 on defense rolls against possession or mental invasion.

You resist possession of your mind by a spirit (enabling it to alter your actions or take you over entirely) as well as mental invasion (sinister whispers, mind-dwelling spies, etc). Eg the Grumbler's invasion of Constance's mind

#### Chaos Resistance \[CR\] {#chaos-resistance-[cr]}

Skill granting 0, 1, or 2 on defense rolls vs. misfortune caused by spirits.

Helps dampen the bad luck effects of the sharing forbidden or secret knowledge.

### Sample Spirit Power Defensive Rolls

**Prediction** \- the warrior knows what you are going to do, and acts preemptively to foil it.  
vs: Intention Shield

**Mind Detection** \- all sneaking, hiding and ambush are foiled. Your location is known.  
vs. Intention Shield

**Curses** \- based on what the curse is.  
vs Body Autonomy for things like blindness, tripping, lock jaw, numb hands etc.  
vs Intention Shield for things like tourettes

**Illusion** \- resist seeing what is not there, or seeing through to the reality below. This isn't a  
vs Reality Discipline

**Non-Perception** \- This is what Grimaldi is using to make memories of him as Barto not exist for most people, and to forestall Bolton's memories to the next day.  
vs Reality Discipline

**Redirection** \- a mental reconstruction of reality makes your actions target an ally instead of an enemy  
vs Reality Discipline

**False Hunger** \- inflicting hunger makes the victim eat constantly, distending their belly. They lose their Speed effort one per day. The hunger is also distracting. If food is visible, they will be distracted by it.  
vs: Body Autonomy, Sensorium Control

**Hopeless** \- believing nothing is possible prompts the target to fail to take action, or trying lackadaisically because what is the point anyway? Prevents you from spending Effort on anything.  
vs. Liberated Mind

**Grim Chance** \- Whatever can go wrong will tend to go wrong, resulting in accidents that injure or socially harm the target(s). Grim Chance can not be resisted when it is the result of disclosing magical information.  
vs. Chaos Resistance

## **Misc Abilities** {#misc-abilities}

Ability: Unearned Trust  
Spend 2 Int and people find they overshare with you. After a conversation in a non-stressful environment, you may roll (including spending effort) against their tier to have them drop a useful piece of information.

Ability: Go Unnoticed (tier 1\)  
Spend 1 Int to not be noticed. In social situations, this means anger, accusations, or questioning can be avoided if there are others to deflect it onto. In battle, if you are being attacked, the attacker simply chooses somebody else. If you wish to apply this to a larger group and fade into the scenery, spend an additional 1 int. If you have used "go unnoticed" during an encounter, anyone who did not successfully attack you will struggle to remember you were present, at GM's discretion.

## **Allowed and Disallowed Abilities** {#allowed-and-disallowed-abilities}

The general rule of magic is "If it can be **caused by a spirit**, it is allowed." Spirit capabilities include:

* Influencing the minds of living creatures  
* Bending or making light and images  
* Moving through most, but not all, substances  
* Reporting what they experience, sharing knowledge  
* Touching matter weakly  
* Influencing living spirits

The corollary is that, if the ability is unlikely but not outright impossible, it is also allowed. Unlikely things might include knowledge, improved senses, agility, or human-limit strength.

In general, the magic system bars:

* Unnatural movement for entities or objects, like teleport, blink, hover, flight, phasing, super speed, or planar travel  
* Transformation into anything non-human, like a werewolf, a crystal, beast, or shadow  
* Changing to unnatural size.  
* Damage inflicted by magical energy or magical force, excepting light.  
* Telekinesis beyond about 15 pounds  
* Knowledge or Technology beyond the date 1817  
* Futuristic things like computers, outer space, autos and planes  
* Damage caused by magic, elements, or forces  
* Raising the dead  
* Time manipulation  
* Splitting your mind or awareness.  
*
