Quinine for Malaria
- The British believe that Gin and Tonic (quinine) sipped at dinner staves off malaria, so most African explorers swear by it.
- In France, quinine was used to cure intermittent fevers of France’s King Louis XIV at the court of Versailles.
- In Rome, the powder was tested by the Pope’s private physician and distributed for free by the Jesuit priests to the public.
- In Protestant England some doctors labelled the Catholic-promoted quinine a “papal poison”. Oliver Cromwell died of malarial complications after refusing “Jesuit Powder”. But by 1677 quinine was accepted.
