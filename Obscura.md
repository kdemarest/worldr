# !Obscura
An Obscura is an entity invisible to the Corruptor's perception. Whatever your level, that level requires 3 permanently consumed Int to continue being obscured, and the level below becomes always-on.

1. Your movements in the world go unseen  
2. Your movements among the overthrown go unseen  
3. Your use of magic goes unnoticed  
4. Your movements near BRs go unseen  
5. You are utterly non-existent to corruptor perception  
6. Same as 4 but passive by permanently activating 3 Int pool.
