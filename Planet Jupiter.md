# Jupiter

# **Overview**

Jupiter's atmosphere is 31 miles thick. The planet rotates rapidly — once every 9.9 hours — and the rapid spinning causes electrical currents in the metallic hydrogen to generate electricity that powers the planet's magnetic field, which is 20x stronger than Earth's and which provides substantial protection from solar rays.

Jupiter is a gas giant dominated by hydrogen and helium, but it consumed a rocky earth-like billions of years ago. That combined with billions of years of bombardment by off-world materials has added most earth-found elements to the landscape, typically at the surface of the vast hydrogen sea.

Things are much more uneven at the gas/liquid boundaries than you might expect, and the layer of liquid hydrogen is relatively speaking quite thin. Solid metallic hydrogen mountains protrude, and also form solid islands in the oceans.

## Surviving

You'll need a suit, woven for you by the Zocto. [Pic](https://www.deviantart.com/kashivan/art/Steampunk-Ironman-498160728), [PIC](https://www.deviantart.com/preilly/art/Into-the-Depths-65405731)  
Later on, you can use a Spirit Thread suit.

# **Regions**

Life exists in the relative calm between the raging Jovian storms, that is, in long latitudinal strips. Moving from one such strip to another is problematic at best, unless you travel under the ocean.

The Corruptor dominates the southern 60% and northern 20% of the planet, but the 20% between is not completely under its control.

Although the wind's on jupiter look tumultuous to us here on earth, don't forget that Jupiter is 12 earths tall. One belt is the size of an entire earth

# **Landscapes**

Above Jupiter circle its many moons. The most notable are Europa and Io. Each is described elsewhere, but when Jupiter's night sky is visible (from Jupiter's mid to upper atmosphere or between the turbulent belts) Europa glows with a constant green and tan aurora leaving a glowing trail, while Io glows like a lava-like orange ember.

## Sea

The hydrogen sea is cold, and dense. Entire planetesimals a mile across float within it, their density floating them 2/3rds below the surface (can vary)

## Islands

Islands of metallic hydrogen protrude through the liquid hydrogen oceans. Within those, helium sub-oceans  and rivers exist; hazy, clearer, fizzy as if constantly boiling.

## Mountains

[PIC](https://www.sciencenewsforstudents.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/1030_alien_atmoshpere_hydrogen.jpg)  
Both hydrogen rivers cascade off the metallic hydrogen mountains as they slowly evaporate. Liquid helium fogs the summits continuously, causing misty clouds around the peaks which glow with internal ball lighting, providing dim, somewhat bluish light. It is inert to all other elements.

## Mainland

There is a rocky interface at the border of Jupiter's slightly purple hydrogen sea. It ripples if too much pressure is applied. Liquid hydrogen is clear but gets a purple tint from the eletrical atmosphere, odorless, tasteless, inert, and if mixed with oxygen highly combustible producing water as a result.

The surface is typically icey, and geysers erupt with regularity.

## Gossamer Rings

There are two gossamer rings around Jupiter, more faint than those of Saturn but nevertheless there. In order, inner, main, Amalthea, and Thebe rings. The main ring has a ring ecology, including Orca swimming within.

# **Weather**

### Constant Lightning

[PIC](https://nerdist.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Jupiter-Superbolts-feature-image-08062020.jpg)  
There is intense electrical activity from time to time and lightning can be seen jumping from Islands to mountain peaks. This drives the upper layer storms, and specifically provides power to the Great Red Spot. Heat is generated by the friction of the storms, so the above-ocean habitable areas are long latitudinal stripes. You must voyage under water, or through fierce   
winds to move to other stripes.

### Fierce Wind

If you're in a band, you're in wind that will flay your skin without protection

### Meanders

In a calm strip the adjacent storms can roil out protrusions much like a river, extending up to 20% of the distance into the calm strip. Very dangerous.

### Diamond Rain

Rain comes in the form of micro-diamonds, some so small you can breath them in, and some about the size of sand. Not dangerous without strong wing, but sometimes hail-sized diamonds fall.

### Ammonia Plumes

When sailing the air, sometimes sudden concentrations of ammonia bloom up from below ([vid](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tq_6DClZ0Ns&t=32s)). Anything caught within may be poisoned or dissolved.

### Geysers

[PIC](https://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/thumbnails/image/pia21442_updated.jpg)  
When heat builds from the planet's core, and surfaces in the ocean, the overlying rock can see a break-through of hot matter, causing a geyser. They can be really huge, There is often warning in the form of gunshot cracking noises and rumbling motion in the ground nearby.

### Plasma Storms

Magnetic storms shoot plasma from the sky, charging the ground and wreaking havoc with metals. They manifest as a kind of tornado that lifts and drops, creating intense heat and localized magnetic anomalies.

Mixing water into liquid hydrogen results in flame. With metallic hydrogen results in combustion.

# **Travel**

A key component of travel is the magnetotron, a device with long comb-line spikes of metal that absorbs electricity from the atmosphere and produces either positive or negative magnetism which interfaces with the planet's natural magnetics for very fast travel.

Walking over many surfaces causes mist to rise from your feet as the liquid nitrogen transforms in the Leydenfrost effect.

### Undersea

### Seaborn

### Iceborn

Large ice boats, capable of holding twelve with a core crew of four, travel the broad icey wastes of the frozen areas of the hydrogen sea.

### Flight

Wind zones are striated, each visually showing as a layer of swirling clouds \- sometimes redder, or white

* Latitudinal travel is relatively easy, but moving from an area of calm into a storm band is a moment of intense crisis.  
* Wind speed illustrations [pic](https://scitechdaily.com/images/Jupiter-Polar-Winds-777x855.jpg?ezimgfmt=ng:webp/ngcb1)  
* Flight in the band gaps, near the ground, is slow, but nearly 500 mph can be attained in jet streams in the middle atmosphere, sinking back to about 35mph near space.  
* Certain jet streams travel as fast as 1,000 mph, especially near the poles, so near-polar travel is particularly fast.  
* The GRS is a constant hazard however, with winds no less than 250 mph, and substantial turbulence at all times.  
* Circumnavigating the planet's middle is a matter of 24 days at top speed (500mph).

## Crystal City

Half buried in ice, the remains of the Zocto center of civilization. It was not under water, because when occupied the Zocto were at their technological peak and everyone had bioadaptations and personal levitation.

## Ward Towers

Made of the same Black Ice found in the Viking Silver Mine, each ward has a tower at the center of its swirling tornado winds. 

## Red Spot

Related to The Corruptor [LINK](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ml4MhMjmapNTFYD-ifeZb_XncwotmAcRF9zSmtC7zb0/edit#bookmark=id.fr63ykkw9vpq)

The spot is the closest thing to an embodiment of the Corruptor: a powerful, swirling storm bigger than the Earth. Humanity has known of the spot since Domenico Cassini described it in 1665\. It rotates entirely every seven days, meaning 150mph winds at the outer edges, and circles the planet every 14 Jovian days.

The reddish color come from phosphorus, an element that is a colourless, semitransparent, soft, waxy solid that glows in the dark.

The german born astronomer Samuel Heinrich Schwabe is earth's foremost authority on Jupiter, and he will be the first to draw the red spot in 1831\.

The rings of saturn, Jupiter, and Neptune are composed of water ice particles. These form a liquid-like substance that certain creature uses to move about in a fish-like manner.

Orca live in hollowed-out asteroids [PIC](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EQiINwRWoAA58L3?format=jpg&name=large). Orca are the primary predators, while whales and massive jellyfish filter the water ice for particles of organic matter.

Mid-sized rocks are plentiful in the rings, home to corals and red algae. In addition, numerous captured asteroids ply the "waters", and certain creatures grab on to them to get rides to more plentiful feeding grounds.

The Cleansing by Dust is using a moonlet extracted from Saturn's rings.
