  
NOTE: There is a Q\&A section at the end. Please add to it if you have questions that are broad and that others might want to see the answer to. Or just make a comment and I'll add the response into Q\&A.

**Party Notes:** KD: We need at least one person to be connected with each of: Politics/Law, Nature, Military, Occult/Archaeology, Medicine, Anthropology

# Texture of the Campaign

The main plot begins with a purely "real world" situation. As mysterious events occur, the group seeks to understand, eventually revealing a path that confronts an evil beyond the scope of normal human senses.

In this campaign the group will

* Sail to distant lands, including some adventures at sea (\~10%)  
* Sometimes travel challenging terrain a few days to a month overland (\~10%)  
* Encounter exotic cultures and often negotiate, befriend, or conflict with them (\~15%)  
* Adventure in difficult-to-reach, often culturally sensitive places, like through a jungle,  along a dangerous river, in exotic buildings, or a in tomb or occult place of worship (\~50%+)  
* Locales might be fraught with creatures both natural and supernatural, mental assaults or trickery, and some traps or puzzles  
* Sometimes return to London or a "civilized" location and intermingle with "people of consequence" (\~10%)

Some of the active verbs will include, in no particular order:

* Discovering, Revealing, Growing (as a person)  
* Sailing, running, swimming and climbing.  
* Fighting, surviving, sneaking, hiding, avoiding traps  
* Negotiating, persuading, deceiving, reading cultural queues, mentally opposing, encouraging or leading others  
* Trading, deciphering language, signs & sigils, and interacting with the occult

In addition, a relatively critical aspect of the players' endeavors will be to collect samples or data from their explorations, including flora, fauna, geography, culture, and the occult. These samples are not merely abstract \- they may provide game mechanics opportunities of various kinds.

# Fate Points

You get Fate Points instead of XP for great role playing (plus one to hand to another player), and can spend them on "Immediate Benefits" and "Short term and Medium term benefits", as well as Player Intrusions. So-called Long Term Benefits are just negotiations with the GM.

# Character Creation

I've heard hopes that there will be narrative creation and interesting character development, as well as character advancement (leveling). I like all these ideas. Without presuming a particular system, here are some aspects of character creation we might consider to support these ideas and the core fiction of the campaign.

**To be clear, any role can be filled by a male or a female.** So when I write, below, "man of action" I am using the customary language of the time, not curtailing the player character's gender. Being female in this campaign is not like being Smurfette, where male smurfs hold title to every occupation or emotion and her occupation is "female".

I imagine most characters will have:

1. A Role  
2. A Background  
3. Growth Opportunities  
4. Possibly a Relic (like a magical focus, but not exactly. details to be discussed)

## 1\. Roles

This list of potential roles is not exhaustive, but gives ideas that are relevant to the plot and the types of adventures likely to be had. I imagine the general categories:

* Man of Action  
* Man of Science  
* Man of Business  
* Man of the Cloth  
* Man of the Sea  
* Man of Privilege

If you find that you are primarily a Man of the Sea or a Man of Privilege, then you should also augment your character to be one of Action, Science or Business as well.

In addition, if you are not inherently a seafarer you should consider taking on some aspect of seamanship as an aspect of your character, if it makes sense. Examples include history with the merchant marine, or growing up on the seaside, or a past stint in the Navy.

Here are role ideas, in alphabetical order. See "Role Descriptions" for details.

African Hunter  
Anthropologist  
Archaeologist  
Benedictine monk		special role \- talk to GM  
Doctor				likely a ship's doctor  
Entertainer			maybe a carny, actor or singer  
Explorer  
Fop				possibly on board for all the wrong reasons  
Free Native			possibly Pacific Islander or African  
Inventor			  
Merchant			seafaring trader, or overland caravaneer  
Naturalist  
Navigator  
Pirate				Carribean or privateer  
Roustabout			a broad skill set  
Sea captain  
Ship's Boy  
Ship's Dog			talk to GM  
Soldier				Infantry, Cavalry, Marine  
Stow away			A younger person, probably  
Traveler from afar		Samurai, Brahman, Hussar

## 2\. Background

In order to facilitate a deeper role play, player characters should enumerate a number of things about their character. Remember that the British are a **class system** struggling towards equality and the rule of law, so you need to know "where you came from".

- Where did they grow up?  
- What were their parents like?  
- Who (or what) did they lose, that mattered to them?  
- What are they proud of?  
- What defines their identity?  
- What do they fear deeply? (See [RB Fear List](http://dndspeak.com/2019/01/100-fears-and-phobias/))  
- What is their addiction/obsession/compulsion?  
- What social class? What magnitude of wealth?  
  - If you are lower class, enumerate some sideline capabilities you might have gotten from your family or community.   
  - What "delicate arts" do you have, for example were you trained in painting, an instrument, dance, cooking, witty reparte, etc?  
- What is their role-playable character flaw? (See [RB Character Flaws](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1aIoDHkxav_tAdUkIZ2oY84UHQoxffgspiHC34udiRSY/edit?usp=sharing))  
- What are you running from or in what way unsuited to British life?  
- What practical expeditionary skill are you cross-trained in? This training can be before the voyage, or during a short period just before and during the voyage.

## 3\. Growth

How will the character grow over the course of the campaign? The direction of a character's personal growth absolutely might change during play, but take the time to think through an initial arc that you think is likely.

Cypher System Character Arcs generally look good to me. I'm hoping that each character will have:

1. **A campaign-spanning Growth Arc** \- some important way in which they are flawed and will learn and grow as a human being. This might cap out at 20-30 sessions, so that it doesn't get too tediously slow. For example:  
   1. A mentally weak character who gives in and does what others say in order to avoid conflict might want to "stand up for myself, and even learn to command others"  
   2. Or a different character, who gets easily angered and yells, might aim for "zen-like balance, tact and patience."  
2. **One or two additional Arcs** in flight at any moment, which are sometimes also Growth Arcs. I'd expect each to resolve in 3 to 6 sessions. As one Arc completes another would tend to emerge. I hope that new Arcs will emerge from:  
   1. The player simply choosing it for their character  
   2. Naturally from play  
   3. From Focus Connections

## 4\. Relic

For various game reasons, characters might have some kind of object that means a lot to them, and to which they feel a strong connection. Supernatural power might enhance character capabilities directly, or pass from a relic to your character over time (as level; increases)

See Powers, below, for details of what a Relic might do.

The origin of a relic's power might be one or more of these:

- emotional significance  
- antiquity  
- acts of genius (a masterpiece)  
- role in a significant historical event  
- possibly something more "formally" enchanting, but this isn't quite what I'm imagining

It might also be that the significance of the mission or purpose lends intrinsic magic to relics. All TBD.

A relic might be very personal and might not convey enhancement to others.

Examples of relics could include

* the ancient antikythera device for a navigator,  
* the ship itself for a sea captain, or perhaps his spyglass  
* Ibn Abdul's "Tome of Civilizations" for an archaeologist   
* the Duke of Wellington's cavalry sword from Waterloo for a soldier  
* a cat burglar's special sneaky shoes of finest lambskin made by his impoverished uncle who really couldn't afford them but made them anyhow on Christmas day  
* a street urchin's lucky rabbit's foot given by his mother as she passed from typhus

# Role Descriptions

**These are loose descriptions of reasonable archetypes that can exist in the game. Use as much or as little as you like when you choose Type, Focus, and Descriptor.**

*The PCs would never have been chosen if they were not extraordinary.* When considering powers, imagine certain skills, knowledge, or capabilities of a Role and accentuate them with:

* going a notch beyond human limits, or  
* adding sixth sense type of accent, or  
* making the unlikely happen, or  
* engaging a mildly occult nuance

## African Hunter

bags exotic game for sport, as a naturalist, or as a paid guide; great with the primitive guns of the day, but also an adept horseman and trainer of dogs. Tracking, knowing the ways of animals, in-depth knowledge of the African bush, able to read animal intent, tracking and survival, distinguish carnivores from herbivores, can avoid poisonous plants and quicksand, Examples: William Charles Baldwin, [Major Percy Horace Gordon Powell-Cotton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percy_Powell-Cotton)

## Anthropologist

studies human culture past and present; can predict what somebody is thinking, or what they might do in a social situation; can "read" a tribe to avoid social faux pas, leverage their beliefs to achieve an end, or gain trust; know the use of unusual tribal artifacts, and can use them; can influence human behavior

## Archaeologist

can read human constructions, understands how things are made and hence sometimes how to make them; might find secret or trap doors, detect traps, understand underground hazards, read strange scripts; sometimes carries a whip.

## Benedictine

specialize in secret and occult knowledge. They can interpret what they see through that lens. Disciplined mind and clarity of thought; Resistant to curses; Strong linkage to an important and esoteric organization; The pope is a former Benedictine. Talk to the GM.

**Entertainer** \- might charm a person into uncharacteristic actions, redirect a social situation, or create distractions; actors can disguise and memorize; carnies might be a tight roper, strong man, remarkably dexterous acrobat, or extreme in size or flexibility; They've seen a lot so streetwise, a good listener

**Explorer** \- experienced at travel, survival, and the pitfalls of entering places you're not supposed to be. Cool under pressure, and wise enough not to go the wrong places or say the culturally fatal thing; Can look ahead and prepare well; Might understand how to lead a team, hire to avoid weaknesses in skill set, negotiating with natives for access, etc. Examples include Roald Amundsen, David Livingstone, Lewis and Clark

**Fop** \- He thinks that he is misunderstood, but in fact he is perfectly understood. Excellent roleplay opportunity for fatal character flaws that might or might not be redeemed. His talent is luck, connections, social glad-handing, alcoholism or an opiate addiction, rapier training, and courtly manners to survive the crustiest of upper crust encounters. His carefree ways might hide a heart of gold, or a strong mind.

**Free Native** \- From relatively primitive tribal cultures anywhere but Europe, for a Pacific Islander or one of the less developed African tribes. Brings a different cultural perspective, and survival specialty in their environment. Can endure hunger and uncertainty. Intuitive hunter and gatherer. Take this if you have a unique cultural twist to add.

**Inventor** \- you know... invents mechanical things. Understands how all the latest technology works and can often see how to apply it in challenging situations. Has a few tricks up his sleeve, and a rather unusual weapon or two. Specialize in being a swiss army knife, and carries a swiss army knife.

Understands a range of herbs, [mushrooms](http://dndspeak.com/2020/08/100-mushrooms-and-their-effects/) and poisons, including fogging the mind or shaping the perceptions; Basic farming skills, and identifying edible plants. The types of wood best for weapons.

**Navigator** \- reads the stars, innate sense of direction, excellent at decrypting puzzles or language; uses astrolabe for finding *many* things, not just directions; highly literate; an excellent mapper, can "read" water, including what was in it lately or what is in it now and where; also amazing at estimating distance of all kinds, including for thrown weapons

**Pirate** \- in addition to sea skill, the pirate can fight, steal and drink; Able to sleep on anything and endure severe conditions; possibly rather unrefined; ties the right knot for every situation; Has seen blood aplenty; can deceive.

**Roustabout** \- a hard-drinking and rough type from the school of hard knocks; talented across many skills; can plan, build and assemble; thrives in the seedier parts of town, streetwise, can gain the trust of classes that are suspicious of the wealthy

**Sea Captain** \- knows how to run a ship, and has some training in every role from mate to navigator and can do them in a pinch. Adds value as a leader, even on land, especially when hope is in short supply. Good at math and accounting, remembering things, reading; Can negotiate and smooth over differences in a group.

**Ship's Boy** \- young, but tough from life at sea. Sponges up knowledge not just from the ship's operations, but also from the other adventurers and can acquire their skills at a lower level fairly quickly. Small enough to go places others can't. Able to blend into certain situations better. Good night Wesley, sleep well. I'll likely kill you in the morning.

**Ship's Dog** \- Why not? Talk to your GM if this interests you.

**Soldier** \- Likely British, but you might be a Hussar or Musselman. Pick infantry, cavalry or marine. Experienced and trained fighter, but also good at following orders, enduring hardship, and keeping cool under pressure.

**Stow Away** \- Probably young, seeking adventure. Likely streetwise, great at sneaking and concealment, and certain forms of crime such as theft, pocket picking, robbery, or breaking and entering. An untrained brawler who doesn't fight fair. A likely young lad, yes, likely to get in trouble.

**Traveler from Afar** \- A cultured person, for example a Japanese Samurai, an Indian Brahman, or a Moslem Poet. This person should bring a unique perspective as well as not shying away from cultural clashes with the rest of the group. Consider taking on one of the other roles in this list, with the traveler role as a layer on top.

# Powers

I'm thinking that many powers won't necessarily be glowing, swirly "magic" but perhaps have effects that are "possible but extremely unlikely", like the smoking pipe from the Middle Earth module.

For plot reasons, mental powers are of interest, but I'm still thinking that through.

I hope that many powers enhance skills beyond natural limits, or create a sixth sense connection. For example:

* A ship captain being so "in touch" with his ship that he knows if she has suffered damage even when miles inland.  
* An anthropologist so passionate about her science that she intuits the symbology of what the tribe's chief is wearing, and knows his mind or how best to approach him

Lots to discuss here.

# Skill List

**Experimental, but in force as of Dec 30, 2020**

Skills (which I'll call "Regular Skills" for the sake of clarity) work as described in the Cypher System, with the addition that you may take any skill marked with **(M)** in the table below as either a Regular Skill, or as a Minor Skill.

### Minor Skills (M)

A skill taken as a Minor Skill costs **half a skill point** (so you can buy two at a time) It may only be used to change the difficulty of rolls **vs the environment** (that is, not against an opponent). If you later wish to "upgrade" it to a Regular Skill, that costs half a skill point if the Minor Skill is Trained, and a full point if the Minor Skill is Specialized.

For example, Andrew takes Escape as a Minor Skill and uses it to escape manacles or a treacherous pit. But when gripped by a Creeping Entwiner his Escape Minor Skill gives no help, nor can he usefully advise Anne how to escape from the Entwiner.

### Countering

A special skill named "Countering" intends to represent the situation when you *understand* a skill. As a Minor Skill, this is where Familiarity ends. As a Regular Skill, instead of being trained to *perform* the Familiar skill, you have enough familiarity to *counteract* it.

For example, if Jane has the skill Familiar:Interrogation, then she is familiar with the techniques one uses during interrogation. She can spot those techniques and act against them, hardening herself against brow-beating or being kept too long in a hot room.

One can imagine using Familiarity to see through disguises, resist being influenced, or better detect stealthy opponents.

### Roster of Skills

In the table below, the words "Pick from" mean you should select one from the list as the actual skill that you take.

This list is experimental. Some skills may be overly broad, but that is the experiment I'm considering.

**SKILL LIST**

| Artist | You may reproduce things you have seen, even if only briefly, with remarkable detail. You paint, sculpt, and work in mixed media. Clients will pay for your work, and art of people will give an asset to influence them. |

# Currency

In 1817 England still uses the pound as currency, but is in "pre-decimal" times. Just this year the government has minted a standard gold coin, the Sovereign, which is known to all to be worth exactly one pound (as opposed to the very uncertain value of prior gold coins)

Money is typically expressed as 12/6, spoken "twelve and six", which means twenve shillings and six pence. Pence is the plural of penny. Formally, it is expressed as £2-5s-3d, which means 2 pounds, five shillings and three pence.

| The below is worth x of the across | Gold Sovereign (L) | Half Sovereign | Shillings | Pence |  |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| 1 Pound Sterling (L) | 1L | 2L | 20s | 240d |  |
| 1 Shilling (s) | 1/20 | 1/10 | 1s | 12d |  |
| 1 Penny (d) | 1/240 | 1/120 | 1/12 | 1 |  |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |

# Q\&A

**Q:** Will player characters grow, including the possibility of attaining super-human or supernatural power?

**A:** Yes.

**Q:** (D.F.) Will the percentages you have listed out change based on level of enjoyment. For instance if we suddenly find the adventures at sea incredibly fulfilling can it change from 15% to 40%. I use the adventure at sea just as an example. I have no idea what we may latch onto.

**A:** Yes. The adventures are custom made, so there is flexibility and I'm interested in being responsive.

We can add as many questions and answers as needed here depending on peoples' hopes and fears for the campaign.

Discussion

* This is an alternate reality, and everyone will make a good faith effort to stay within the bounds.  
* If you want to invent things with knowledge you could only have after 1817, you probably won't be able to.  
* KD: Revisit the Inventor role, because it might be impossible to play  
* Perhaps all characters are escaping from something, or a misfit of some kind.  
* If we get bogged down in rules, the GM can just make a ruling and the group moves on.  
* People should have disads, and have the roleplaying flexibility to experience them and let them affect the narrative, rather than optimizing combat capabilities all the time. People disliked that you "got something" for taking them.  
* Character evolution as in-game  
* Reference Films: Master and Commander; One movie from the "Sharp" Series; 1/3rd of Sense and Sensibility

Systems:

- **FATE \+ (SteamPunk or Gothic Horror)?** D is reluctant for a long campaign. Hauser didn't like having to buy things he wasn't going to use in order to get the things he didn't want; Maybe **FATE Accelerated**; likes the Golden Rule where even the room can get stats/aspects.  
- **Cypher** was very class and level oriented. Biggles didn't like character creation very much. Likes point-buy based systems  
- **Genesys**? Dudley "funky dice"; but willing; D: Made the party a little samey, but might be the setting. Dave:   
- ~~Icons \- too superhero, and too~~  
- **BRP** \- Dudley mentioned the Call of Cthulhu rules set; might be a good rules fit. Ken should check out that 1880's version of the game. D says it is a completely skill-based system, and has character progression.  
- Dave is just ambivalent. If you have just a basic framework that doesn't do much, he'll enjoy it like just sitting around and chatting and joking. A bit of crunch make it a bit better because you get to level the character and explore options of play.

-   
- Relics are probably "Cyphers" that happen to be re-usable  
  - KD; define what these are exactly  
  - Reading: "Last Call" "Stress of Her Regard"

## Treasure Acquired by Party

- **Throck** Golden leopard with rubies \- ([pic](https://dma.org/sites/default/files/styles/slideshow_medium/public/slideshow_images/Sword%20ornament%20in%20the%20form%20of%20a%20lion_2010.2.McD_.jpg?itok=YiLByAG-)) \- Sympathy with its spirit gives you leopard capabilities. Gain an asset in silent movement, hearing, leaping, climbing, and initiative. Person can choose, and then that is what they have the rest of the day.  
- **Gahan** Pair of Gold Rings \- ([pic](https://i.imgur.com/HLBgK8I.jpg)) Wear these rings and they enable sympathetic communication between the bearers in times of stress. You know the state of that person.  
- **Gahan** 11 Akan Bronze Figurines \- ([pic](https://assets.catawiki.nl/assets/2016/5/14/4/e/0/4e0dfd4c-19ea-11e6-852b-9458b08fe005.jpg)) Can be gifted to persuade or engage

It can clasp and suck the blood of enemies. The size of a child's hand. Needs verbal commands. Made of gold it isn't tough, but it will do simple things you say. No intellect.  
- **Bean** Ring of Anansi \- ([pic](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcSOz494fqe5Qae3iC1339DtTch5RkzCvue7FQ&usqp=CAU)) This golden ring, crudely made to have eight legs, gives the wearer advantage attempting to decipher any story or symbols in any language. Also the ability to tell spellbinding stories.  
- **Henton** Gold Shield \- ([pic](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/25/Afrikaabteilung_in_Ethnological_Museum_Berlin_81.JPG/1280px-Afrikaabteilung_in_Ethnological_Museum_Berlin_81.JPG)) Cleanse an area of bad luck (gives a second roll)  
- **Henton** Bronze Jar and Lid \- ([pic](https://assets.xupes.com/Images/Product/7557/SingleImages/Main/Superb-Antique-Ashanti-Kuduo-Bronze-Figural-Lidded-Jar-1920th-C.jpg)) Can hold many spirits, not for use, but to preserve them as allies.  
- **Bolton** Ivory Fertility Figure \- ([pic](https://media.sandhills.com/img.axd?id=4379573101&wid=&p=&ext=&w=0&h=0&t=&lp=&c=True&wt=False&sz=Max&rt=0&checksum=A9aOIkEubLK6hWgHqDB6ECJqCwa%2B82vX)) Literally makes you fertile and (manly and) attractive. Everyone will notice. You will be looked up to, and noticed.  
- **Bolton** Ivory Comb \- ([pic](https://i.pinimg.com/564x/58/51/22/585122bdee91818dc21a0527980771f3.jpg)) Can help disguise someone. Makes you look like you would wish to look.  
- **Bolton** Bronze war horn goldweight [PIC](http://www.vam.ac.uk/__data/assets/image/0003/223788/2007BL9788_goldweight_ghana_custom_290x429_6362034859.jpg)
