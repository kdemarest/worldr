There are eleven planets in the solar system.

These planets, Ceres (1801), Pallas (1802), Juno (1804), and Vesta (1807), are actually asteroids orbiting between Mars and Jupiter. They were considered planets until the 1850s. So the planets are:

1. Mercury  
2. Venus  
3. Earth  
4. Mars  
5. Ceres (discovered 1801\)  
6. Pallas (1802)  
7. Juno (1804)  
8. Vesta (1807)  
9. Jupiter  
10. Saturn  
11. Uranus (discovered 1781 by William Herschel \- note that it was not known to earth's ancient civilizations)
