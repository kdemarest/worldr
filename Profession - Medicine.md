### Medical

## **Limits of Medicine in 1817**
* **No germ theory:** Doctors believed in miasma (“bad air”), humors, or hereditary weakness as causes.
* **Bleeding and purging:** Still the dominant therapies.
* **One success:** Jenner’s smallpox vaccination.
* **Public health absent:** Cities had no clean water or sewer systems; disease prevention only began to be addressed decades later.


**Quinine for Malaria**

* The British believe that Gin and Tonic (quinine) sipped at dinner staves off malaria, so most African explorers swear by it.  
* In France, quinine was used to cure intermittent fevers of France’s King Louis XIV at the court of Versailles.  
* In Rome, the powder was tested by the Pope’s private physician and distributed for free by the Jesuit priests to the public.  
* In Protestant England some doctors labelled the Catholic-promoted quinine a “papal poison”. Oliver Cromwell died of malarial complications after refusing “Jesuit Powder”. But by 1677 quinine was accepted.

### **1\. Tuberculosis (“consumption”)**

* **Cause (modern knowledge):** *Mycobacterium tuberculosis*, spread by coughing in close quarters.

* **Cause (1817 understanding):** Thought to be hereditary, or caused by bad air, dampness, or poor morals.

* **Impact:** Leading cause of death in Britain throughout the 19th century. Young adults often wasted away slowly.

* **Treatment in 1817:** None effective. Doctors recommended rest, good diet, fresh air (sea voyages, “sanitaria” in countryside), and bleeding or tonics. Nothing stopped progression.

### **2\. Smallpox**

* **Cause:** Variola virus.

* **Impact:** Disfiguring, often fatal, particularly in children.

* **Treatment:** None. Only supportive care.

* **Prevention:** Edward Jenner’s cowpox-based *vaccination* (1796) was available by 1817, but still resisted by many. Britain was slowly rolling it out, and inoculation with cowpox was the one real medical intervention that *worked*.

### **3\. Typhus (“jail fever” or “gaol fever”)**

* **Cause:** *Rickettsia prowazekii*, spread by body lice.

* **Impact:** Epidemics in prisons, ships, workhouses, and slums. High fever, delirium, rash; often fatal.

* **Treatment in 1817:** None effective. Doctors used bleeding, purging, opiates. Best chance was escape to cleaner air. Disease outbreaks stopped only when conditions improved (clean clothes, washing, less crowding).

### **4\. Typhoid Fever**

* **Cause:** *Salmonella typhi*, from contaminated food and water.

* **Impact:** Common in cities with poor sewerage. High fever, abdominal pain, intestinal bleeding.

* **Treatment in 1817:** No cure. Only supportive measures (opium for diarrhea, bleeding). Mortality was high.

### **5\. Cholera (new arrival)**

* **Cause:** *Vibrio cholerae*, spread through contaminated water.

* **Impact in 1817:** The **first global cholera pandemic began in 1817**, spreading out of India. It did not hit Britain until 1831, but reports of its devastation were noted by British doctors.

* **Treatment in 1817 Britain:** None yet. When it arrived later, bleeding, opium, and calomel (mercury chloride) were used—all ineffective.

### **6\. Malaria (“ague”)**

* **Cause:** *Plasmodium*, carried by mosquitoes. Still endemic in marshy areas of Britain (especially the Fens, Kent, Essex).

* **Treatment in 1817:** Quinine bark (*cinchona*) was available and did help, but supply was limited. Most poor patients went untreated.

---

### **7\. Syphilis & Gonorrhea**

* **Cause:** *Treponema pallidum* (syphilis), *Neisseria gonorrhoeae*.

* **Impact:** Very common in urban areas, spread by prostitution and lack of protection.

* **Treatment in 1817:** Mercury ointments and pills—poisonous, often worse than the disease. Some relief but no cure.

---

### **8\. Childhood Diseases**

* **Measles, whooping cough, scarlet fever, diphtheria.**

* **Causes:** Viral or bacterial, spread rapidly in households and schools.

* **Treatment:** None effective. Mortality high, especially under age 5\.

---

### **9\. General Malnutrition & “Fevers”**

* Malnutrition (rickets from vitamin D deficiency, scurvy in the poor, pellagra in some regions).

* “Fevers” was a catch-all term doctors used for many infections they couldn’t distinguish.

* **Treatment:** Diet advice, bleeding, purging, herbal tonics—rarely useful.
