# Medicine

In a word, "quack".

If you are sick, it is probably because you are a bad person, or somehow offended god. Disease is spread by "bad vapors". Bleeding and purging are the top cures for many ailments.

Growing in popularity are:
* Phrenology - reading the bumps on one's head
* Galvanism - the idea that electricity make animals operate
* Mesmerism - like hypnotism but stranger

So-called "Electric Parties" are held where dead bodies are shocked and made to twitch.

The one ray of light: Edward Jenner's **smallpox vaccine** is saving thousands, while the radical Dr Pinel of France has struck off the literal shackles of the insane and begun treating them as sick people rather than demon possessed. Not so in London.

## Limits of Medicine in 1817

* No Antibiotics  
* No Vaccines
* No Anesthesia  
* Bleeding and purging - Still the dominant therapies.
* No Regulation - Cities had no clean water or sewer systems; Doctors could do almost anything and be tolerated

## Trends in Medicine

### The Good

* Botanical Cataloguing as Cure-Hunting – Expeditions send home crates of plants believed to hide new medicines; collectors treated like alchemists of the age.
* Comparative Anatomy – Cuvier’s influence spreads: fossils and bodies compared to divine templates, promising insight into extinct beasts and human origins.
* Statistics in Medicine – A tiny avant-garde attempts to count outcomes rather than rely on authority, hinting that numbers could dethrone dogma.
* Medical Moral Treatment – The idea that calm routines, work, and respect might treat mental illness—Pinel’s reforms echo but have not yet crossed the Channel.

### The Bad

* [Phrenology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phrenology) - Perceived as revolutionary, gaining in acceptance. One's history, propensities, and moral character can be determined by examining the bumps on the head.
* Galvanism (animal electricity) – Experiments suggest electric force might re-animate muscles, hinting at life’s secret mechanism.
* Mesmerism (Animal Magnetism) – Patients fall into trances under the influence of invisible “fluids” guided by the physician’s hands or magnets.
* Vitalism – Life is governed by a unique spark or force absent in dead matter; chemists argue whether it can be isolated.
* Craniotomy for childbirth – Surgeons begin touting embryotomy tools to save the mother by sacrificing the child, seen as bold rather than horrific.
* Physiognomy – Character and moral worth “read” from faces, profiles, and expressions; used by employers and police informally.
* Chemical Medicine (iatrochemistry) – Early chemists push the idea that disease is chemical imbalance, not moral or spiritual failure.


## Common Maladictions

* !Infant mortality – 15% of children die during childbirth, and 20% more die before age five. 1% of birthing mothers also die. Every family carries fresh grief and names are reused for the next newborn.
* !Dropsy – Swollen legs and belly mark a slow drowning from within, and once it appears the grave is already measuring.
* !Cholera – Sudden vomiting and unstoppable watery flux empty a person in hours, leaving only a husk and a stench.
* !Typhoid – Fever, delirium, and a crawling rash strike after foul water, and caretakers pray not to share the cup that killed.
* !Fainting – A swoon may signal shock, shame, pregnancy, hunger, or death approaching from behind a velvet curtain.
* !Whooping cough – A child coughs until they choke for breath, then gasp a desperate whoop that freezes every adult in terror.
* !Measles – A rash blooms like red embers across the skin, and the fever burns worst in the young and crowded.
* !Malaria – Marsh air and night bites bring chills and fevers that return like a debt, weakening even the strongest over seasons.
* !Rheumatism - Pain twists the body into knots, leaving work undone and futures shortened.
* !Tetanus – A small wound stiffens jaw and spine until the victim arches like a bow and breaks themselves trying to breathe.
* !Syphilis – Flesh rots behind polite smiles. Treated by nearly killing the patient with arsenic.

## Common Quack Practices

* Tobacco smoke enemas - for drowning and other uses. Stations are set up all along the Thames for such treatments. [LINK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco_smoke_enema)  It declined (slowly) after 1811, when Benjamin Brodie demonstrated that nicotine is a cardiac poison.  
* **Leeches and bloodletting** are used for many ailments, like smallpox, epilepsy, and plague. Bloodletting is proved stupid by Alexander L Hamilton [LINK](https://www.jameslindlibrary.org/articles/alexander-lesassier-hamiltons-1816-report-of-a-controlled-trial-of-bloodletting/) but the result is ignored.  
* **Mummies** \- the human body is used as an ingredient in many medicines, including mummies for epilepsy, bruising, and hemorrhaging  
* **Mercury** is used to treat melancholy, syphilis, and influenza.  
* **Arsenic** for sleeping sickness and sexual diseases and disorders, and food storage.  
* **Collapsing the Lung** \- Tuberculosis and lung problems of all kinds used plombage to forcibly collapse the lung to improve healing.  
* **Excision** \- Stutter is sometimes treated by excising part of the tongue.  
* **Electrification** - Electrotherapy was new in the 1700s, but it was used regularly until the early 1900s for illnesses like epilepsy, paralysis, impotence, tapeworms, and more. 
* **Female Climax** - Though masturbation is considered a significant sin, various medical practices climax women as antidotes for depression and other maladies.

## Narcotics

* Few pain-killers and zero knockout drugs exist  
* Opium is prevalent, but mostly sent to China
* [Laudanum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laudanum) exists, an addictive opiate used for cough and pain. It is a pill made from opium, saffron, castor, [ambergris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambergris), musk and nutmeg.  
* Cannabis is rare, mostly found in Bengal.

## Substances

* Mineral springs - highly regarded, and spas are well populated by the elite  
* Arsenic - used for everything from ulcers to syphilis  
* Stramonium - used for almost everything  
* Belladonna - used by women to enlarge their pupils to be attractive, and for asthma  
* Various purgatives  
* Acids such a nitric acid  
* Nitrous Oxide exists, but won't catch on for 20 more years

## Other Techniques

* Trepanning is still used  
* Auscultation (a wooden tube precursor to the stethoscope)  
* Forensics, such as detecting murder by poison  
* Variolation, the precursor to inoculation, for smallpox  
* Amputations due to gangrene  
* Purging of the stomach with emetics  
* Lithotomy to remove kidney stones exists, not yet replaced by lithotripsy.  
* Moxa, the burning of plant material near or upon the surface of the skin, to stimulate Qi.

## Instruments

* The [Auscultator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stethoscope), at the time a wooden tube, is invented in 1816 by Rene Laennac in Paris.  
* Microscopes exist  
* Surgical Instrucments includde scalpel, bones saws and tongs, but the injection needle is years away.
* Blow pipe - an intense hydrogen oxygen mixture which for the first time melts gems and certain metals

## Notes: Quinine for Malaria

* The British believe that Gin and Tonic (quinine) sipped at dinner staves off malaria, so most African explorers swear by it.  
* In France, quinine was used to cure intermittent fevers of France’s King Louis XIV at the court of Versailles.  
* In Rome, the powder was tested by the Pope’s private physician and distributed for free by the Jesuit priests to the public.  
* In Protestant England some doctors labelled the Catholic-promoted quinine a “papal poison”. Oliver Cromwell died of malarial complications after refusing “Jesuit Powder”. But by 1677 quinine was accepted.

## Illness Details

### **1\. Tuberculosis (“consumption”)**

* **Cause (modern knowledge):** *Mycobacterium tuberculosis*, spread by coughing in close quarters.

* **Cause (1817 understanding):** Thought to be hereditary, or caused by bad air, dampness, or poor morals.

* **Impact:** Leading cause of death in Britain throughout the 19th century. Young adults often wasted away slowly.

* **Treatment in 1817:** None effective. Doctors recommended rest, good diet, fresh air (sea voyages, “sanitaria” in countryside), and bleeding or tonics. Nothing stopped progression.

---

### **2\. Smallpox**

* **Cause:** Variola virus.

* **Impact:** Disfiguring, often fatal, particularly in children.

* **Treatment:** None. Only supportive care.

* **Prevention:** Edward Jenner’s cowpox-based *vaccination* (1796) was available by 1817, but still resisted by many. Britain was slowly rolling it out, and inoculation with cowpox was the one real medical intervention that *worked*.

---

### **3\. Typhus (“jail fever” or “gaol fever”)**

* **Cause:** *Rickettsia prowazekii*, spread by body lice.

* **Impact:** Epidemics in prisons, ships, workhouses, and slums. High fever, delirium, rash; often fatal.

* **Treatment in 1817:** None effective. Doctors used bleeding, purging, opiates. Best chance was escape to cleaner air. Disease outbreaks stopped only when conditions improved (clean clothes, washing, less crowding).

---

### **4\. Typhoid Fever**

* **Cause:** *Salmonella typhi*, from contaminated food and water.

* **Impact:** Common in cities with poor sewerage. High fever, abdominal pain, intestinal bleeding.

* **Treatment in 1817:** No cure. Only supportive measures (opium for diarrhea, bleeding). Mortality was high.

---

### **5\. Cholera (new arrival)**

* **Cause:** *Vibrio cholerae*, spread through contaminated water.

* **Impact in 1817:** The **first global cholera pandemic began in 1817**, spreading out of India. It did not hit Britain until 1831, but reports of its devastation were noted by British doctors.

* **Treatment in 1817 Britain:** None yet. When it arrived later, bleeding, opium, and calomel (mercury chloride) were used—all ineffective.

---

### **6\. Malaria (“ague”)**

* **Cause:** *Plasmodium*, carried by mosquitoes. Still endemic in marshy areas of Britain (especially the Fens, Kent, Essex).

* **Treatment in 1817:** Quinine bark (*cinchona*) was available and did help, but supply was limited. Most poor patients went untreated.

---

### **7\. Syphilis & Gonorrhea**

* **Cause:** *Treponema pallidum* (syphilis), *Neisseria gonorrhoeae*.

* **Impact:** Very common in urban areas, spread by prostitution and lack of protection.

* **Treatment in 1817:** Mercury ointments and pills—poisonous, often worse than the disease. Some relief but no cure.

---

### **8\. Childhood Diseases**

* **Measles, whooping cough, scarlet fever, diphtheria.**

* **Causes:** Viral or bacterial, spread rapidly in households and schools.

* **Treatment:** None effective. Mortality high, especially under age 5\.

---

### **9\. General Malnutrition & “Fevers”**

* Malnutrition (rickets from vitamin D deficiency, scurvy in the poor, pellagra in some regions).

* “Fevers” was a catch-all term doctors used for many infections they couldn’t distinguish.

* **Treatment:** Diet advice, bleeding, purging, herbal tonics—rarely useful.
