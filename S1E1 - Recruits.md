# Scenario – Recruiting

<Prelude – read the reminders>

* The coins you have been given have a strange luster to them. You wish you had thought of them during that odd moment before your vision in the Roman Cistern.

What a sight it was, dear readers, to see the valiant re-capture of His Majesty's royal baboons concluded with a triumphal march through the city streets. Delays in the unveiling of the new baboon attraction at the Royal Menagerie were finally explained when it was revealed that the howling, swinging monsters had absconded into the London Sewers, of all places. One would think they had rather leap to the London Tower parapets and swing about! "Nobody was ever in danger from these gentle creatures," said Daniel Smythe, looking quite the worse for wear in ripped pantaloons and reeking like the Thames. Accompanying him were several brave and resourceful souls, soon to be recognized for their fearless service to the crown. Upon the animals' recapture in the evening Thursday, onlookers were certainly surprised to see a troop of monkeys, strung together by rope around their necks, escorted by powerful, capable, and loyal men from many walks of life. Upon arrival at the Menagerie entrance, Mr. Smythe declared "The exhibit will open within the week! Get your advance tickets at the menagerie box office for just one shilling!" And we certainly will, dear readers, we certainly will.

## Pre-Game

* Daniel's wife (status quo)  
* Roman cistern (TBD. Impossible to find?)  
* JS Grimaldi (gone from cellar. Disguises himself as crew)  
* Moira  
  * Has made the lab incredibly tidy. She has built her own broom, and is using a scientific burner (not a Bunsen burner) to cook a stew in a mid-sized iron pot PIC loaned to her by the fishwife.  
  * Has stored the scrolls properly  
  * GM: She has also made copies of both  

Bartholemew Skaggs – Charlie searching for researcher

## Prologue

* Newspaper story comes out hailing the "Monkey Troopers" who rescued the Crown's monkeys  
* Constance gets a numb hand, from lifting the skull, but it seems like maybe it is the cuts. This should remind of the coin. Visiting doctors is no avail, surgeons no help, but she can get a palm reader. For a fate point it can be a decent one, an old gypsy woman. PIC  
* Gahan should get gear from a different ship, or the Greenwich observatory, to keep things simple. Maybe he sees the giant lens first!  
* Moira's translation of "grind" the black bones isn't exact. It could be anything from pulverize to dissolve.  
* Skull  
  * If they grind it, a gypsy comes and asks to buy it  
  * The skull is blacker than I've been showing. PIC  
  * What do with skull? (Remember the scrolls mention of black bones)

* Gypsy Palm Reader  
* They noticed the blackness of the bone  
* Meet Daniel later about his wife  

### Notes

* Henton should start walking the path of magic before others, but be unable to disclose.  
* Bolton has the Abbott's secret; met Darwin  
* Lucian has the BT secret  
* William can prepare the Oil of Vitriol  
* Constance – Father Kensington visits her dreams.  
* Henton gets a pillow allergy, and compulsively checks wardrobes.  
* William has seen the contents of Constance's purse.

# Part 2: The Strange Interview

Resolve:

* What happens to the skull  
* Three days until the “interview”  

Each player character is approached by an appropriate method – sometimes a charismatic person, sometimes a mentor they respect, sometimes simply by letter – and given a major incentive to embark upon an expedition to the Gulf of Guinea, also known as the Gold Coast.

## The Pamphlet

Awakening on the morning of the 18th of June, you find an envelope sealed with wax bearing the heraldry of the Benedictine Order. The envelope contains a thin gold coin, and a pamphlet, which reads,

> “You are cordially invited to present yourself for a most important Mission of Mercy for which your special talents shall receive Significant Recompense. Make yourself known to the Benedictine Monk at the Westminster Abbey southern door, at noon, on the 1st August. Bring this pamphlet.”

## The Wait

A small group begins to gather outside the door just before noon. It is so dark from the strange red skies that nearby gas lamps are aflame. (Possibly someone has never seen a gas lamp like that before.) One of the lamps is shooting out flame, scorching the glass and metal guard enclosing it. A man (who turns out to be the inventor) hurries towards it carrying strange tools.

Street urchins gather to watch. As the man examines the gas lamp's mechanism, you notice (roll 3) that an older child (Streaky) reaches down into the bag, lifts a tool and turns away with it hidden by his body. The inventor does not notice.

< A slightly older child, apprentice to a tailor, trips a fleeing kid and returns the stolen purse >

## Entry

The prospective team is told to gather at the southern door of Westminster Abbey. The ancient door looks nearly unused, as if the Abbotts have only opened it in rare times of need for hundreds of years.

A monk with a tonsure, wearing black robes of sackcloth, opens the door. About his waist is a belt of knotted rope, and a hood covers his head. He points to his mouth and you are made to understand that he has taken a vow of silence. After examining your pamphlet, he locks the door behind you with a key as large as his hand.

You are led through the back of the church. Occasional holes peek out into the enormous chancel. You can see the boxes where the nobility sit, and realize that anyone sitting there would be easily observed and overheard from your position.

Taking up and lighting whale oil lamps, you head down a flight of stone steps, water appearing on the stairs.

You emerge into the tombs below Westminster. Entering a door to your right you see a kingly stone sarcophagus, pitted with time, adorned with a metal scepter and crown in the center of the room. PIC  
(roll 3 history: it is Edward the Confessor)

Beneath, an ornate pavement seven hundred years old, known as the Cosmati pavement, adorns the floor. Narrow shafts of sunlight filter through innumerable holes in a hidden window high above. The monk lifts a metal scepter from the bas-relief hands of the king. After gazing intently for a moment at the shafts of sunlight on the floor, the monk touches the scepter to four runed locations upon the stone sarcophagus. A stone door, concealed in the wall, eases silently back.

Another set of stairs leads down. Partway down, in the dim light of the lamps, you see a small dig through the stone wall. The flickering light reveals ancient piping and a wall of bones. PIC  
Players: any actions?

At the bottom of the steps is a second door, reinforced with iron bands and ancient wood. The monk reaches his entire arm into a hole. His face looks nervous. After ten seconds of doing something in the hole, he releases his breath and withdraws his arm holding a large key. He uses the key to unlock the door. Stepping through he locks the door behind and drops the key into a slot in the wall.

Passing through, the group walks with echoing steps through a long, empty colonnade. There is a faint light at the end. PIC  
Roll 4 to recognize original work from Edward's time.

## The Gathering

The room is large, with an arched ceiling. Around the walls are unusual lamps (arc lamps).

Numerous people are seated in the room on former wooden pews obviously repurposed as benches. Three men sit in high-backed chairs, the center of which is upholstered with red velvet. The other two are plain wood. PIC

## The Announcement
