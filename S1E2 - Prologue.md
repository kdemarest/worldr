# Scenario \- Recruiting

**\<Prelude \- read the reminders\>**

* The coins you have been given have a strange luster to them. You wish you had thought of them during that odd moment before your vision in the Roman Cistern.

*What a sight it was, dear readers, to see the valiant re-capture of His Majesty's royal baboons concluded with a triumphal march through the city streets. Delays in the unveiling of the new baboon attraction at the Royal Menagerie were finally explained when it was revealed that the howling, swinging monsters had absconded into the London Sewers, of all places. One would think they had rather leap to the London Tower parapets and swing about\! "Nobody was ever in danger from these gentle creatures," said Daniel Smythe, looking quite the worse for wear in ripped pantaloons and reeking like the Thames. Accompanying him were several brave and resourceful souls, soon to be recognized for their fearless service to the crown. Upon the animals' recapture in the evening Thursday, onlookers were certainly surprised to see a troop of monkeys, strung together by rope around their necks, escorted by powerful, capable, and loyal men from many walks of life. Upon arrival at the Menagerie entrance, Mr. Smythe declared "The exhibit will open within the week\! Get your advance tickets at the menagerie box office for just one shilling\!" And we certainly will, dear readers, we certainly will.*

### Pre-Game

* Daniel's wife (status quo)  
* Roman cistern (TBD. Impossible to find?)  
* JS Grimaldi (gone from cellar. disguises himself as crew)  
* Moira  
  * Has made the lab incredibly tidy. She has built her own broom, and is using a scientific burner (not a Bunsen burner) to cook a stew in a mid-sized iron pot [PIC](https://www.ouririshheritage.org/wp-content/uploads/cms/6_gallon_Pot_113.jpg) loaned to her by the fishwife.  
  * Has stored the scrolls properly  
  * GM: She has also made copies of both

Bartholemew Skaggs \- Charlie searching for researcher

Prologue

* Newspaper story comes out hailing the "Monkey Troopers" who rescued the Crown's monkeys  
* Constance gets a numb hand, from lifting the skull, but it seems like maybe it is the cuts. This should remind of the coin. Visiting doctors is no avail, surgeons no help, but she can get a palm reader. For a fate point it can be a decent one, and old gypsy woman. PIC  
* Gahan should get gear from a different ship, or the Greenwich observatory, to keep things simple. Maybe he sees the giant lense first\!  
* Moira's translation of "grind" the black bones isn't exact. It could be anything from pulverize to dissolve.  
* Skull  
  * If they grind it, a gypsy comes and asks to buy it  
  * The skull is blacker than I've been showing. [PIC](https://i.imgur.com/s9JgG3U.jpg)  
  * What do with skull? (Remember the scrolls mention of black bones)

* [Gypsy Palm Reader](https://content.foto.my.mail.ru/mail/olga.n1988/2303/h-4748.jpg)  
* They noticed the blackness of the bone  
* Meet Daniel later about his wife

Notes

* Henton should start walking the path of magic before others, but be unable to disclose.  
* Bolton has the Abbott's secret; met Darwin  
* Lucian has the BT secret  
* William can prepare the Oil of Vitriol  
* Constance \- Father Kensington visits her dreams.  
* Henton gets a pillow allergy, and compulsively checks wardrobes.  
* William has seen the contents of Constance's purse.

# Part 2: The Strange Interview \=======

Resolve:

* What happens to the skull  
* Three days until the "interview"

Each player character is approached by an appropriate method \- sometimes a charismatic person, sometimes a mentor they respect, sometimes simply by letter \- and given a major incentive to embark upon an expedition to the Gulf of Guinea, also known as the Gold Coast.

## **The Pamphlet**

Awakening on the morning of the 18th of June, you find an envelope sealed with wax bearing the [heraldry of the Benedictine Order](https://www.heraldry-wiki.com/heraldrywiki/images/thumb/e/ea/Tyniecabbey.png/350px-Tyniecabbey.png). The envelope contains a thin gold coin, and a pamphlet, which reads,

*"You are cordially invited to present yourself for a most important Mission of Mercy for which your special talents shall receive Significant Recompense. Make yourself known to the Benedictine Monk at the Westminster Abbey southern door, at noon, on the 1st August. Bring this pamphlet."*

## **The Wait**

A small group begins to gather outside the door just before noon. It is so dark from the strange red skies that nearby gas lamps are aflame. (possibly someone has never seen a gas lamp like that before). One of the lamps is shooting out flame, scorching the glass and metal guard enclosing it. A man (who turns out to be the inventor) hurries towards it carrying strange tools.

Street urchins gather to watch. As the man examines the gas lamp's mechanism, you notice (roll 3\) that an older child (Streaky) reaches down into the bag, lifts a tool and turns away with it hidden by his body. The inventor does not notice.

\<A slightly older child, apprentice to a tailor, trips a fleeing kid and returns the stolen purse\>

## **Entry**

The prospective team is told to gather at the southern door of Westminster Abbey. The ancient door looks nearly unused, as if the Abbotts have only opened it in rare times of need for hundreds of years.

*A [monk](https://www.blackravenarmoury.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/benediktus-schwarz-600x600.png) with a tonsure, wearing black robes of sackcloth, opens the door. About his waist is a belt of knotted rope, and a hood covers his head. He points to his mouth and you are made to understand that he has taken a vow of silence. After examining your pamphlet, he locks the door behind you with a key as large as his hand.*

*You are led through the back of the church. Occasional holes peek out into the enormous chancel. You can see the boxes where the nobility sit, and realize that anyone sitting there would be easily observed and overheard from your position.*

*Taking up and lighting whale oil lamps, you head down a flight of stone steps, water appears on the stairs.*

*You emerge into the tombs below Westminster. Entering a door to your right you see a kingly stone sarcophagus, pitted with time, adorned with a metal scepter and crown in the center of the room.* [PIC](https://www.historytoday.com/sites/default/files/articles/kingjohn_0.jpg) (**roll 3 history**: it is Edward the Confessor) *Beneath, an ornate pavement seven hundred years old, known as the Cosmati pavement, adorns the floor. Narrow shafts of sunlight filter through innumerable holes in a hidden window high above. The monk lifts a metal scepter from the bas relief hands of the king. After gazing intently for a moment at the shafts of sunlight on the floor, the monk touches the scepter to four runed locations upon the stone sarcophagus. A stone door, concealed in the wall, eases silently back.*

*Another set of stairs leads down. Partway down, in the dim light of the lamps, you see a small dig through the stone wall. The flickering light reveals ancient piping and a wall of bones.* [PIC](https://i.insider.com/5603d123dd0895d3138b46d5?width=1100&format=jpeg&auto=webp) **Players**: any actions?

*At the bottom of the steps is a second door, reinforced with iron bands and ancient wood. The monk reaches his entire arm into a hole. His face looks nervous. After ten seconds of doing something in the hole, he releases his breath and withdraws his arm holding a large key. He uses the key to unlock the door. Stepping through he locks the door behind and drops the key into a slot in the wall.*

*Passing through, the group walks with echoing steps through a long, empty colonnade. There is a faint light at the end.* [PIC](http://PIC) **Roll 4** to recognize original work from Edward's time.

## **The Gathering**

The room is large, with an arched ceiling. Around the walls are unusual lamps (arc lamps).

*Numerous people are seated in the room on former wooden pews obviously repurposed as benches. Three men sit in high-backed chairs, the center of which is [upholstered with red velvet](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/proxy/dyGQfC8am2AnsDzn3ReuWAFbqYusnWvnjA2hQVK11cAGW5NKRWTCj0XJu6FMRHQllIun4rKfMzLTEqffmFGKUnlkRUTgKE_VU137ic3QRIkEO0JT9g). The other two are plain wood.* [PIC](https://www.westminster-abbey.org/media/12218/pyx-chamber.jpg)

Sitters:

* Reginald Castlebury (left chair)  
* Abbott Geoffrey (center chair)  
* Richard "Bean" Gilroy (right chair)

The other people attending are:

* [William Lambert](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ml4MhMjmapNTFYD-ifeZb_XncwotmAcRF9zSmtC7zb0/edit#bookmark=id.a4ae3uhuc2my) \- the famous cricketer, now disgraced. He is glum, a bit angry, and ready to tell how Beauclerk hired false witnesses. If pressed he might let slip that those witnesses didn't even have the facts right. Implying he *was* fixing the game.  
* [Penny Trotsky](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ml4MhMjmapNTFYD-ifeZb_XncwotmAcRF9zSmtC7zb0/edit#bookmark=id.ooqapg2ozjkk) \- She is a female librarian and historian from the British Museum.  
* [George St. James](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ml4MhMjmapNTFYD-ifeZb_XncwotmAcRF9zSmtC7zb0/edit#bookmark=id.fgqulsas33b1) \- Scottish landholder, lace factory capitalist. Overthrown.  
* Gareth Towerfield \- Pampered man about town with 2,000 a year.  
* Hayfarthing Schiller \- A butcher  
* Terrence Merrywhistle \- An accountant

*Present in the room are the following people:*

* *William Lambert, the famous cricketer. He looks glum and a bit angry.* [PIC](http://PIC)  
* *A modest young woman, conservatively dressed, wearing spectacles with bifocal lenses. Were she of a higher class, she might wield a lorgnette instead.* [PIC](http://PIC)  
* *A man, clearly wealthy and clearly a lord, with the angular face of a Scotsman.* [PIC](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/34/George_Frederic_Watts_%281817-1904%29_-_Francis_Napier_%281819%E2%80%931898%29%2C_10th_Baron_Napier_and_1st_Baron_Ettrick%2C_Diplomat_and_Governor_of_Madras_-_PG_811_-_National_Galleries_of_Scotland.jpg)

* *A red-faced, barrel-chested man with hands calloused by manual labor.* [PIC](https://c8.alamy.com/comp/X359F0/miller-ferdinand-von-18101813-1121887-german-metal-worker-portrait-wood-engraving-19th-century-X359F0.jpg)  
* *A young gentleman of the middle class, with a skeptical smile and an air of excitement at the adventure that must await.* [PIC](https://i.imgur.com/YMOjzNO.jpeg)

## **The Announcement**

GM: There is a bit of time to chat with others in the room, if the players desire it.

The group is the last to arrive. A man rises from the left chair and says,

*"Welcome to the Westminster Abbey undercroft. I am Reginald Castlebury, administrator for the Royal Mission of Mercy here in London.*

*At the behest of the Benedictine order, and funded by both the general public and luminaries of science and government, a ship named King's Mercy has been chartered. In an effort to stem the relentless tide of smallpox deaths, a crack team is to bring smallpox vaccine through dangerous territories to native populations around the world, starting with the Gold Coast, and continuing until our substantial funds are depleted, likely many years from today.*

*The core team on this journey shall be recognized for their heroic efforts by the King himself, granted a stipend of L500 per year, and granted such titles and privileges as the merit of their service should recommend to his royal highness.*

*On the way this team will observe and gather archaeological treasures, anthropological  information about foreign cultures, new knowledge of the natural world, as well as negotiating terms for future scientific visits. Sample gathering is not optional, and no member of the team is "too good" to help with this important work.*

*The mission is dangerous. You will enter hostile territory, populated by predatory animals, oppressive heat, jungle diseases, hostile natives, and if the stories are to be believed, shamans that can influence or cripple the mind. Thus the core team shall include those versed in the martial arts, wilderness survival, medical practices, and the ability to move through hostile territories undetected.*

*Your health and fitness must first be confirmed. An oath must be taken. If anyone does not feel capable, or feels unsuited to such a dangerous mission of mercy, they are free now to depart.*

GM: Gareth gets up and leaves

## **The Screening**

First meeting is a screening of parts. Each person is taken, one at a time, to a separate room with a monk and another man, quite obviously a physician. 

*A monk in Benedictine black, with an open, friendly face and arms the size of tree trunks greets you. He seems at ease.* [PIC](https://offbeatoregon.com/assets-2015/1505c.odermatt-mt-angel-abbey-339/adelhelm-odermatt-in1916-380.jpg)

*The monk says, "I am brother Sampson. Old chap, your health will be put to the test on this mission. Far away places with rare diseases and all that. We wouldn't want to put you at risk if you aren't in tip-top shape, you see."*

*He leads you to the first station, saying, "I do apologize, but doctor Jones here is a mute and can not speak."*

### Station 1 \- Healthy

*This room is mostly bare, with whiter rectangular wall tiles and a slightly sloped concrete floor leading to a brass drain in the center. In an upholstered chair rather too elegant for the bare room sits a man with an intelligent, placid face.* He gestures to a solidly built wooden chair. [PIC](https://www.art-prints-on-demand.com/kunst/gabriel_lemonnier/jean.jpg)

*The physician stands and begins to check your pulse, examining your eyes and teeth and so on. As he works you can read what he is about. He is a man defiant of conventional thinking. His gaze seems to say, 'many claim to know, but I am one of the few who actually knows.' Not only does he think he is smarter than you, he likely has proof of it.* It is [Jean Nicholas de Corvisart des Marets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Nicolas_Corvisart), former physician to Napoleon now in hiding, an extraordinary anatomist and heart specialist. 

* **Roll 7** to recognize Corvisart  
* **Roll 3** with sight to see one of Corvisart's spirits during the exam.

*From his coat pocket the physician takes a polished wooden tube, simple but of very fine workmanship, tapered at one end. Brother Sampson says, "This instrument was invented just last year to aid in a technique called Auscultation. Please relax and breathe deeply." The doctor holds one end of the device to your chest, listening, and then your back and sides. He taps firmly upon various places on your body, seemingly listening to the echoes that resound within your body. He makes notes.*

### Station 2 \- Free

*Entering another small room, you see an unusual upholstered table bearing a pillow, covered with a cloth. Hanging above it is a large inverted box, seemingly made of a thick gray metal,  open at the bottom, as large as the upholstered table. Glass beakers of numerous substances simmer above small flames on a heavy oak table nearby.*

*A stout monk dressed in Benedictine black stands in the room. Near the wall stand two soldiers armed with sabres. One holds a cord that leads to a pulley above the strange metal box. Both wear an unusual helmet that appears much thicker than usual. Their eyes fix upon you and never waver the entire time you are in the room.*

*The monk smiles reassuringly and says, "I am brother Advar. Would you mind terribly lying upon this examination table? I realize it appears a bit odd, but it is quite comfortable and the very latest technique for examining health."*

*Taking up long tongs, the monk reaches into a large metal flask filled with smoking liquid, using the tongs to withdraw a strange bronze object.* [PIC](https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,h_1669,w_2479,x_0,y_0/v1554918148/shape/mentalfloss/514246-briancampbell.jpg?itok=-1esNLlt)  *He says, "Please hold this dodecahedron in your left hand. Wrap your hand around it, like so. Please do not allow your fingers to enter the interior."*

*The monk holds a weight on a string, like a plumb bob, beside your head.* [PIC](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0978/7942/products/298593_1900x.jpg?v=1497014157) *Taking a hot beaker of blue-green oil he pours a bit of oil upon the plumb bob, then gently sets it swinging parallel to your head. Like a pendulum, the device swings freely. The monk's face reveals nothing as he makes a note in his notebook.* 

* **Gahan** will observe the pendulum swinging non-linearly away from his head.  
* **Constance** will see it veer ever so slightly towards her. The monk's expression gives away that this is bad.  
* **Roll 5** to recognize a character inscribed upon the plumb as similar to those upon the scroll.  
* **Roll 3** with Science/Chemistry to recognize vials of blue copperas (blue vitriol) from which Oil of Vitriol" can be prepared.

### Station 3 \- Compassion

*This small room has a door that closes silently with a muffled thud. A rather aged and decrepit man dressed in tweed and a silk undervest, in glasses, with a short beard, sits in an upholstered chair beside a divan.* [PIC](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/ce/Hegel_by_Schlesinger.jpg) *Beside his chair is a small, well made table containing this book.* [PIC](https://kettererkunst.com/still/kunst/pic570/445/411700397.jpg)*.*

* It is Georg Hegel  
* Roll 3 to decipher that the book says "*The Phenomenology of Spirit*"

*He asks you to lay down with your head propped on a silk pillow. "Please gaze at this thurible." he says in a thick german accent. It swings slowly to and fro.* [PIC](https://i.etsystatic.com/6031936/r/il/121e2f/180255746/il_794xN.180255746.jpg)

*He asks you about your day. How was breakfast? How did you come to the abbey? What do you hope for during this interview? What are your concerns about the prospective voyage?*

*He talks about how he is here in London to pick up his illegitimate son Ludwig. He wants to make things right, after all the boy is ten years old and never lived with his true father.*

*Then he says, "While walking along in desert sand, you find a tortoise flipped on its back. The tortoise lies there, its belly baking in the hot sun, beating its legs, trying to turn itself over, but it cannot do so without your help. What do you do?"*

* GM: The player must help it, or be disqualified.

### Station 4 \- Talents

*A middle-aged man, with care-worn eyes, dressed in a turban greets you. Two lit lamps stand upon a table. [PIC](https://i.imgur.com/aF8baEb.jpeg) You sit on opposite sides of a table, like one might find at a cafe. Many strange objects litter the table \- a ball of crystal, an oversized and ancient looking deck of cards, and 1815 Almanac, six green candles and a seventh red candle, numerous books, a number of stone shards with runes upon them, a pair of bone dice with six sides, four types of flowers in a vase, a small but very sharp dagger with a jeweled pommel, a small black skull, a ring of copper, a feather quill pen and two pots of ink. He lights the seven candles, red last, and douses the lamps. For a moment he gazes intently at your face. Not seeing what he hopes for, he sighs.*

*He says, "Please hold this dodecahedron in your left hand. Wrap your hand around it, like so. Please do not allow your fingers to enter the interior. Now. Do you see anything inside the object?"* [PIC](https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,h_1669,w_2479,x_0,y_0/v1554918148/shape/mentalfloss/514246-briancampbell.jpg?itok=-1esNLlt)

* **Roll 1** gazing into the dodecahedron. **Henton** sees it. if you see spirits. You will see it. Roll to hear or smell a spirit.  
* Gaze through the copper ring at a candle. Nobody can see anything.  
* Shows you a page. [PIC](https://olddisgruntledbastard.files.wordpress.com/2015/07/alchemy.jpg) Does this mean anything to you?  
* Roll to read a rune. **Bolten** can do it. He also sees that the pieces of paper produced by others are a random squiggle.  
* Roll to copy a rune with the quill pen. **Bolten** can do it.  
* Roll to hold a flower and consider what is important about it. **William** will cause the flower to sweat a blue oil.  
* What am I thinking? Brother **Lucian** gets it right.

# Part 3 \=======

\<\< Do the madman sequence here\>\>

### Station 5 \- Morality

*This room is small, with an arched ceiling. Water seeps from above, and has done so for so long that calcium formations create white streaks down the stone. An unusual apparatus stands to one side, with a cage containing numerous mice. Blood stains the bottom of the cage.*

* Roll 5 tracking (speed/int) to note drag marks out a door. Somebody was pulled out, dragging their heels.

*A Brother with a lump showing on his forehead wheels over the apparatus, placing a small cage before your eyes. He introduces into it a live mouse, which squeaks and leans its paws against the bars of the tiny prison. The Brother steps out of the room, leaving you alone. [PIC](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9e/Mouse_in_a_cage.jpg)*

*Above the mouse hangs a heavy stone slab. Metal spikes protrude below. There is a small pin, and you can clearly see that removing the pin will impale and kill the mouse. [PIC](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1550697851-920b181d8ca8?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&ixid=MXwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHw%3D&auto=format&fit=crop&w=1050&q=80)*

* GM: Players should write their answers in secret, then reveal. Removing a small pin will release the stone and clearly impale the mouse. What do you do?

*Without any visible change to the apparatus, the spiked stone slab begins to descend towards the mouse. You can easily stop the movement, but your finger will be pricked and likely bleed if you do.*

* GM: You can choose to stop it. What do you do?

### Station 6 \- Variolation

*Brother Joyce and the doctor return to the room. In his hand the doctor bears a lancet about a quarter inch long. You can see that there is some sort of red, yellow and green goop upon the edge of the lancet. Brother Sampson asks you to roll up your sleeve, and announces that this is your smallpox variolation, fresh from the pustule of a bearer of the pox.* [DETAILS](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1200696/)

* GM: Player must decide.

*Brother Joyce say, "Did you know that variolation was introduced to London by Lady Montague? It is her house, you know, that is the current British Museum."* [PIC](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1200696/figure/F2/)

* **Roll 2** to see if you have a reaction. If you do, you develop a fever for a day (-1 on rolls) and must **roll 3** against temporary blindness.

At the end Brother Sampson says, *"One last thing old chap. A few more details about the trip need to be discussed, but these must remain rather private. Hush hush, you know. If you don't mind, we'll need a short oath later. Nothing elaborate.  Rather mandatory, you know."*

## **A Madman**

GM: determine who is waiting, and who is elsewhere

*A shout is heard from Station 5\. There is a heavy crash, and sounds of a scuffle. The Scottish Lord bursts from the room. He eyes are wild, his left hand is bloody. He clenches something small and fleshy in his right fist. He leaps suddenly upon \<player\>.* **Roll 4** to avoid.

*"Don't harm him\!" shouts brother Sampson, but it is unclear whether he means that Scot or the victim. Struggling as brother Sampson wraps a rope around his arm, the wild-eyed Scottish lord attempts to shove whatever he holds into \<player's\> mouth.* **Roll 3** Might defense.

George St James  
*His eyes are red, not in a bloodshot way, but the edge of the cornea. The pupils are large, black and dilated.*  
*Health 14-4-4, Armor 2*

* Bloodless \- never bleeds  
* Bad luck aura \- does 1 int per round  
* Maddening touch \- defend 4 or reel back stunned  
* Fevered grip \- does 4 speed and numbs the target's limb  
* Manic bite \- does 4 might  
* Fanatic's Strength \- in a single round, can throw off or free himself of all attackers.

GM: All attempt to tie him up, and return him to the table at Station 2 where he can be strapped down. Roll 4 might to restrain just one arm. A person must be on each limb to subdue him.

*You can see the doctor with a wound to his head. He rises with a white kerchief and holds it over the lord's mouth. Then the strange box that hovers over the upholstered table is lowered, sealing the mad lord inside.*

GM: Afterwards roll 5 to overhear Reginald Castlebury say to the man in the center chair, the abbot, "Well, I guess we don't know everything, do we?" to which the abbot replies, "True, yet we did detect him, did we not? We must expect losses."

## **The Oath**

*After the medical examination only the party remains, plus the barrel-chested man, the bifocal-wearing woman, and the young accountant seeking adventure.*

*Rising from the center chair, a man introduces himself. "I am Abbott Geoffrey, a minor officiant of the Benedictine monks here at Westminster." Abbott Geoffrey apologizes for the disturbance, but gives absolutely no explanation for it. Instead he says that there is an additional task, and asks if anyone is unwilling to be sworn to secrecy. If so, they may depart at once, for after the oath you are* 

He then administers this oath:

*"I hereby solemnly swear and agree, upon my honor and all that I hold sacred, not to reveal, nor by mission of action cause to be revealed, the true purpose of our mission to any person, living or dead."*

## **The Task**

After the oath, he continues,

*"There is more than smallpox threatening the Gold Coast. War, so recently abated with Napoleon's defeat at Waterloo, again threatens the Empire.*

*A leader of the mighty Ashantee civilization near Africa's Gold Coast seeks to reinstate the slave trade which the Empire has worked so hard to eradicate. Proceeds from that trade enrich British enemies, and threaten the Empire.*

*This leader, named Osei Tutu Kwame Asiba, has gone mad. Once a civilized, cultured, wise and peaceful king, he has begun a campaign of cruelty against his own people and the renewed capture of thousands for enslavement.*

*This madman is being assisted by European powers. His destabilizing influence will breed chaos along the Gold Coast, re-igniting the African slave trade. If this happens an alliance of the Spanish, the Dutch, and the restored Bourbon monarchy will begin a new war of aggression against our noble British Empire, upending the hard-won victory of Lord Castlereagh at the Congress of Vienna. Even now our valiant West Africa Patrol vigilantly watches that vast coast, at great expense to the crown. They need our aid.*

*The symbol of Osei Tutu's power, without which he can not rule, is a type of artifact called a "Black Relic," held by his people as a sacred symbol of his divine right to rule. We need you to find and destroy this sacred relic, leaving the shattered pieces in the public square before his palace.*

*We must succeed, lest the Empire be consumed in a war more deadly than the depredations of Bonaparte, while the very enslavement of thousands hangs in the balance.*

*If you choose to leave now you are free to go, with the stipulation that you maintain your oath of secrecy. If you choose to stay, you are bound by honor to see it through to the end.*

*He pauses for anyone to leave. Then a smile breaks across his face.*

*"Now that you are committed, let me introduce Richard Gilroy who will join you as advisor on the expedition." The third man rises from his chair. His face bears an expansive smile. He is clearly relieved that the right team has been found, and he radiates confidence that you will do an excellent job. "Please, do call me Bean. Everybody does. I am so very pleased to make your acquaintance."*

GM: Bean hands out coins of Edward the Confessor to anyone who doesn't already have one. [PIC](https://www.coinarchives.com/9694cdef0ad93cead12b57a81867309d/img/cng/115/image01061.jpg)

GM: Bean is super-trustworthy, friendly, when you speak with him it is clear he has your personal best interests at heart and that, under his guidance, the expedition will go swimmingly. He positively reeks of competence, experience, intelligence and tact.

## **NPC Choices**

The party may **choose two** of the following to join their team, either as a party member or to have as a resource on the ship. Each time the party rises one tier, they may take on one additional extraordinary NPC.

[William Lambert](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ml4MhMjmapNTFYD-ifeZb_XncwotmAcRF9zSmtC7zb0/edit#bookmark=id.a4ae3uhuc2my)  
Strategic, petty, goes all out to win. Great with a cudgel, excellent throwing power and accuracy with hand-held missiles, can deflect incoming missiles and defend others. Fastest man on the team, with stamina to run for hours. Can anticipate enemy tactics or give an asset to do so.

Hayfarthing Schiller  
Dumb, strong, stalwart, and good with a machete. As a butcher he produces more meat when butchering game, and gives an asset to understand the unique uses of any animal. After he sharpens edged weapons they ignore one point of armor during the first fight in which they are used.

[Penny Trotsky](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ml4MhMjmapNTFYD-ifeZb_XncwotmAcRF9zSmtC7zb0/edit#bookmark=id.ooqapg2ozjkk)  
Quiet and shy. Gets a roll to have brought along any book you might happen to need, typically giving advantage to rolls on most knowledge and sciences. Having read every important ship's log from the age of discovery she bonuses all navigation and response to unexpected sailing problems or emergencies.

## **The Mandate**

Each person is handed a piece of paper containing the expedition mandate:

1. **Variolation**: Journey to Cape Coast Castle and Coomassi, there to administer vaccine to as many as will abide the process.  
2. **Documentation**: You are to document all you see. Keep a log of all events. Produce drawings of what you experience.  
3. **Naturalism**: Take samples of novel life forms: plants, insects, etc. Samples of hair must be taken of the native population, but only from someone who can not add sums above ten. Medicinal plant concoctions, and the origin plants, are valuable.  
4. **Cultural Artifacts**: Collect unusual artifacts from the tribes you encounter. Bead work, metal crafts and so on; but if you see something truly unusual, especially made of lead or gold, you must acquire it even if the risk is great.
