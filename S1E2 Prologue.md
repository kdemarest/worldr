# Scenario: Prologue

**Team Objective:** When a plot is overheard at a cricket match, the team must save an Sicilian abbot from death or kidnapping.

All is not as it appears. The abbot is Prince Regent George IV, and the danger is a Black Relic buried below the Cosmati pavement before the tomb of Saint King Edward the Confessor at Westminster Abbey.

## Player Motivations

* <character> gets paid to "watch the front of the alley" by Streaky, a younger kid who he hates. Streaky, Duff and Old Farm. But, being down on his luck, shillings are shillings.
* Archaeologist, with a pocket full of grant money, is there with his helper Franklin, and a device. Oliver is meant to watch the equipment and take position to help with measurements, The objective is to use the Oscillatory Radio Vibraphone and vibrations from the trampling herd of people to attempt to identify ruins or major objects in Lord's Cricket Grounds. Also, he can't help but be fascinated by the anthropological significance of such a gathering and its ramifications. The grant money will be used to hire urchins to hold silver sticks to help with triangulation.
* Con is there to stay sharp, identifying unusual characters, tracking them, and discovering their motives. It is a simple exercise to keep in top form.

* The Oscillator is a large pan marked with a grid of lines, holding a very thin sheet of 100% alcohol. It must be strung to the walls with twine, leveled, and as it vibrates intersecting wave peaks must be noticed. These can be extrapolated by angle to the ground above as a 3D point cloud indicating shapes. To image the area , you must take above ground readings, then enter the sewers, set up the equipment, which takes about an hour, and take measurements.

## Backstory

George IV feigns a dandy, actually battling the Corruptor in concert with the Benedictines. He visits the tomb of Edward the Confessor sometimes because the tomb holds words of power that must be re-learned every month to ultra-clarify the mind, and he uses this to plan and see forward in his work against the Corruptor. But our story starts at Lord's Cricket Grounds at the 11th annual Gentlemen vs Players match.

## Setup

While attending (or participating in) a grand cricket match, enmity between Lord Frederick Beauclerk and William Lambert erupts. Their intrigues and jealousies explode into a match-fixing scandal with the top player William Lambert being banned from playing at Lord's Cricket Ground for life.

* **Beauclerk** - Vicar of Kimpton and a deady dull preacher. At age 44 still puts cricket first. Captain of the All-England team. Holds world record for highest individual innings.
* **Lambert** - a pro cricketer and the first man ever to score two centuries.

The setting is Lord's Cricket Ground. It is the 11th annual Gentlemen vs Players match, when the upper crust go against the professionals. The Gentlemen, of course, are lead by the world record holder Lord Frederick Beauclerk. The players, by William Lambert, the first man to bat two centuries.

It is a grudge match and the crowd is huge. Everyone knows that only, seven years ago, Lambert bowled wide against Beauclerk, who lost his temper and his wicket. Lambert won by 15. Beauclerk was humiliated. The day is bright and the crowd is huge, perhaps a thousand people milling about, setting up lawn chairs. Some sit in pavilions erected before dawn, as servants serve them hors d'ouvres. The lower classes sit on blankets. Bookies roam, crying their odds and kids act as "runners" exchanging bets and tickets.

## Sequence

1. Assess the teams as they hup hup and squat. Examine them (roll) and also get a Cypher.
2. Arch finds a nearby alley to enter the sewer. Maybe even asks a "nice young man", who offers to help carry the gear and knows of a nearby sewer entrance.
3. Con sees a suspicious character carrying a very odd device (Arch) and follows from curiosity.
4. Arch is jumped in the Alley. Roll: to see if the OVR is damaged when you are pushed. Con saves him, with a round or two of combat. Urch (who is only guarding) trips (GMintrusion and give a dex cypher) as the others flee.
5. Pass a Sewer Hunter PIC
6. Setup in sewer after. PIC
7. Overheard:
   1. Overheard: Two women speak: "Yes, I'm from Kimpton. Beauclerk is my vicar, may the lord have mercy on us all." "Indeed! Why would you say that, my dear?" "Let me put it this way Alice. Paint drying is an absolute Ginnett's Circus compared to one of his sermons. Uncle Filbert claims the word of the Lord graces him best with his eyes closed, but the old codger has learned to sleep sitting up!" <giggles>
   2. Overheard: Hear Beau talking to directors of the league. "Why is Lambert even still playing? He is very suspicious. Round Arb bowling, can you imagine? We all know he isn't one of us." reply: "I dare say old man! But two centuries, what a feat!" Beau: "Not a feat if one cheats with the old Round Arm! And that wide bowling. Just downright bad sportsmanship." reply: "Oh rather. But you see we need just one bit of evidence, old man, and the bell is rung. But how can I ring it without?"
8. Team emerges while Franklin watches the gear. Arch needs them to stand in locations
9. Lambert greets Beau, in front of a large crowd. He is superior; talks down to Beau's humiliation. Makes a LARGE personal bet with Beau, knowing that Beau's team will bowl hard early. Note that Lambert has a lower class drunk for a father. People know because he shows up to matches and shouts drunken encouragement. Their interaction goes something like this:

Lambert idly kicks dust onto beaus shoes, as if by accident.  
**B:** Perhaps if you win you can afford new britches. It isn't done to wear the same pair every game. Oh, but I don't mean to be unfair. Really, how could you have known?  
**L:** Yes, how could I? Oh, my dear fellow, have you recovered from your illness?.  
**B:** My dear chap, why, I haven't been ill...  
**L:** Oh my mistake! I thought wide bowls had brought on another bout of apoplexy.  
**B:** What a gentleman you are to be so solicitous of my health. In return I wish your father the best as he recovers. I know you wish to pattern yourself after his example.

10. Place bets: winner, wickets, how many will wear floppy hats... anything. Meeting with Bookie - bet on almost anything.
    1. Lambert to win, torn pant; 5 lbs
11. Lambert looks furtive. Overhear Lambert speaking with two of Beau's team mates. He asks them the plan. They say "low early, high late". He slips them envelopes. If those can be taken and switched...
12. Play begins. In the sewer measurements are taken. More overheard:
    1. Hear it at tent, after switching with a kid
    2. Overheard: down a nearby passage. "From Sicily. <muffled reply> No, no. Thursday at sunset. You don't want to know how we got the information. <muffled reply> What, you think Benedictine Abbotts have magical powers? Just do the job. <muffled reply> Right. Hide it under Odoricus' Cosmati. When he steps over it, we will have him."
    3. GM: somebody pulls a tile from the wall. It shatters. The figures move away.
    4. Encounter: a herd of hogs runs through, threatening to disrupt the equipment.
13. Tea time! Our party emerges and takes tea (of course). They learn Beauclerk's team made low scores early. While doing so, they notice that Beauclerk doesn't take a rest.
    1. See Beau talking to fake witnesses. They suddenly have reservations about lying - that is, nobody knows there is an ACTUAL fix. They are making it up. More money is promised.
    2. Beau catches you after the men leave; social conflict - did you overhear? If not, fine. If so, he tries to buy you off with favors, access to matches, or money.
    3. Players could follow the men, and threaten then with being exposed if the falsely testify.
    4. Or they could tell Beau that they actually saw the fix being put in.
14. Tea Time Betting is allowed.
15. Play resumes
    1. More measurements. The dots are abstract coordinates until you can model them as a projection in three dimensions.

## Cosmati Research

Westminster has two Cosmati pavements:

1. In front of the the altar  
2. Around the tomb of Edward the Confessor

The PCs may learn about #1 by consulting eg a scholar at the library or certain Westminster monks. The researcher they might find is **Reginald Jones**. You learn where he breakfasts. He can reveal, as can certain monks at Westminster, the following:

* Odoricus was the monk that handled architecture for parts of Westminster
* The tile before the altar is a Cosmati design, utterly unique. "The extraordinary pavement in front of the high altar at Westminster Abbey was installed starting in 1268. The fascinating design has an overall fourfold symmetry and certain elements repeat, but on the other hand every part of the design is unique. The men who did the work came from Rome. This sort of abstract tiling was a Roman specialty, called in the west of Europe "Cosmati" after one of the leading families in the business. The supervisor of this project was named Odoricus, about whom hardly anything is known"
* If they ask at Westminster, they may learn that a visiting Italian abbot is to be given special accord, and full access to any part of the abbey. This is very rare.
