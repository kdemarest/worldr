# PART 2 \===============================

### To Westminster

On the way to Westminster the PCs are rather delayed.

They have at least **two random encounters** from the London Streets from the [London Street Encounters](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ml4MhMjmapNTFYD-ifeZb_XncwotmAcRF9zSmtC7zb0/edit#bookmark=id.a1mph6h5k63n) table.

Entering through the South Gate, they pass the graveyard. Anyone with Spirit Sight can see a momentary vision of a grave: Willem Wilberforce, abolished slavery. This is not currently true \- it only happens in 1833, three days before his death.

### Save the Abbot

*When you arrive a service is in progress. A number of people sit in the forward pews, listening to a service. If you approach respectfully, there are spaces in the pews. A few people wander on the fringes, admiring the stonework. Numerous Irish are present, perhaps twenty, lighting candles for some of the hundred thousand dead from Typhus due to the strange Year without a Summer. Sitting on a pew together at the front are two black robed monks. One seems to have some level of rank, but it is unclear what. A priest stands in the pulpit above the monks and other congregants. The altar area stands empty, cordoned off with red velvet rope.* [PIC](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/95/Pulpit%2C_Westminster_Abbey_%283611666002%29.jpg/471px-Pulpit%2C_Westminster_Abbey_%283611666002%29.jpg)

GM: The PCs may act. As they act they will hear the following (summarize from this [actual sermon](https://archive.org/stream/sermonspreachedi00tren/sermonspreachedi00tren_djvu.txt)) As they go, the sounds of the sermon drift to wherever they are.

GM: Pick the most kindly looking PC:  
*A woman walks up to you. She is plainly dressed, clearly lower class, probably Irish. She seems on the younger side, but it is hard to tell her age because work in the sun and the cares of a difficult life have left their mark. Her eyes look red, as if she has been recently crying. With a very thick Irish accent she says, "My name is Moira O'Connor. A pleasure to meet you." and holds out her hand to shake. This is rather forward, more appropriate to a business deal than a greeting, and yet...*

GM: If shake, she says, *"I will be assisting you today. What is my first task?"*

### Investigations

Visiting the altar is very improper. You may, but quickly you are shooed away by a priest, and the crowd glances scornfully at you. Persistent players get a visit from angry Irish candle-lighters.

PREACH 1: *So says Romans 13:12: "The night is far spent, the day is at hand: let us therefore cast off the works of darkness, and let us put on the Armor of Light. Let us walk honestly, as in the day."*

GM: **Irish**: An Irish woman candle-lighter, weeping, complains of a strange man knocking the candle from her hand. It was for her boy, dead of the Typhus these twelve days. She points to a man who furtively enters a door leading to the spiral stairs to the second level.

PREACH 2: *These words herald the coming of the Lord, in his majesty, to judge the quick and the dead, in the final hours of existence, and none may escape that day. No king, no soldier, no tanner, no smith, for all shall be judged. Many are the signs and warnings which God has graciously given in his Holy Word, to the end that this great and terrible day, however it may overtake the world, may not overtake people unawares. The night is far spent\!*

GM: **Agent**: At some point a man dressed in garb of an unidentifiable country will be seen, Chased into the spiral staircase between levels, and confronted. He will **suicide** with a pill if captured, freeing himself from overthrow just long enough for this:

*The strange, dead-eyed man grips your lapel with white knuckles, a frothy foam bubbling from his lips. Suddenly looking into your eyes his gaze clears, and he seems to really see you for the first time. Pulling you towards him he gasps **"King David wore the fiery diamond of seven-starred Jupiter."*** GM: this refers to the star cluster on the [Cosmati](http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Restored-Cosmati-pavement.jpg) that is northwest of the center, with seven green-and-red stars of David. The one to the left of center has a redder arm, in diamond shape, that when pressed allows you to rotate the planet and reveal a compartment.

PLOT 6: *The priest descends from the elevated pulpit. The hooded figures turn such that you can see the front of their robes. They are not Italian Benedictines at all, but rather German Cistercians\! Just at that moment, Reginald Jones hurries up to you, trying to be quiet and respectful but clearly upset and urgent. "There is another Cosmati, in the crypt of Edward the Confessor\! Oh my, I hope I haven't steered you wrong."*

* Players may guess where the crypt door is, or ask somebody. The Irish all know.

*At the entrance to the staircase leading down to the tombs a single guard stands, wearing non-descript garments. He sports a dashing mustache, an immaculately cropped beard, and eyes that speak of long campaigns and hardship. A key hangs from his belt, and the unlocked door stands open, showing stairs descending to the crypts. Time is of the essence.*

GM: Guard is a [King's Guard](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ml4MhMjmapNTFYD-ifeZb_XncwotmAcRF9zSmtC7zb0/edit#bookmark=id.hlw2nabgd89g). See the bestiary for details.

* **Convince**, confront, trick, disable, or slip past the guard. He may seem to submit to an overwhelming force, and take a hostage when arriving in Edward's tomb.  
* If you **charge**, he enters the stairs and locks the gate (roll to see if he is fast enough)  
* If you **ask nicely**, he will lock the gate and deliver a message, succumbing with his lord (a collapse and clatter will be heard)

PREACH 3 \- WHILE CONFRONTING GUARD: *Darkness yet struggles with light, pierced through as it retreats by the glittering shafts of the true King of Day. Long and weary was the night when heathen idolatry and superstition divided the world. Four ravening beasts Daniel saw coming up out of the sea, yet more beasts appear, and ever more. In their hand is the whip, and they drive the innocent before them. The day is at hand\!*

TOMB: *Entering a modest stone chamber, an elaborate rectangular tomb stands in the middle of the chamber. You see the Italian Benedictine Abbot kneeling before the tomb, bent over it intently, carefully examining or perhaps reading inscriptions upon the ancient metalwork. Suddenly he begins struggling to breath. Something is happening. Everyone is suddenly overcome within their mind. A fist beats against your unconscious soul. What is happening?*

* **Roll 4 vs overthrow**  
* **Roll** 4 to see a black vapor, not a soul, seeping up from the Cosmati pavement.  
* **Roll** to find a secret compartment accessed by pressing a certain stone, per the note found by Reginald. [PIC](http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Restored-Cosmati-pavement.jpg) Applicable skills might include symbology, architecture, that sort of thing, difficulty 5\.  
  * **Cypher**: Divine the contents of a case, compartment, or bag.  
* **Compartment**: Within the hidden compartment is the blackened skull of a monkey inset with bronze [PIC](https://i.imgur.com/s9JgG3U.jpg). Black veins creep across its surface, ever in motion.  
* Read next **Preach**, then  
* **Skull resolution**  
  * see [Black Relics](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ml4MhMjmapNTFYD-ifeZb_XncwotmAcRF9zSmtC7zb0/edit#bookmark=id.9txoukadh695) for powers and how to disable  
  * **Carrying** Edouardo out works, but the skull will follow, hovering, and overthrow the guard or a nearby alterboy.

PREACH 4 \- AS SKULL IS DISCOVERED: *Our globe-spanning empire finds the beasts in their depredations. They must be delivered\! Ever subtle are the works of evil. Let the lord guide our hands\! Let us cast off the works of darkness\!*

PREACH 5 \- AFTER FIRST FAILED ATTEMPT, OR ON SUCCESS: *Thessalonians says, "Let us, who are of the day, be sober, putting on the breastplate of faith and love, and for a helmet the hope of salvation." God bless the prince regent George. Let his instrument of Empire cleanse the wicked of the world, and all who hear these words: You are of the day, and must do the works of the day. Put on the armor of light\!"*

GM: If he goes too many rounds without being rescued, he falls on his back and his arms start to cross over his chest

* **His face**: Now After, you can see the face of the abbot more clearly. [PIC](https://www.royal.uk/sites/default/files/images/encyclopaedia/rs191884_403435-lpr.jpg-edit.jpg)

MEETING: *Relief shows on the face of the black-robed abbot. Lifting his head, he speaks with a flawless upper class English tone: "Your intervention is most welcome. I am Abbot Edouardo of the Sicilian Benedictines, and you have saved my mind from overthrow. You have performed a great service for the Empire, and I will be certain the best people learn of your deed. Let me thank you, and then I must urgently depart."* 

* Roll DC 5-8 to recognize him as His Royal Highness Prince Regent George IV ([NPC](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ml4MhMjmapNTFYD-ifeZb_XncwotmAcRF9zSmtC7zb0/edit#bookmark=id.vle9uo3o2f6d)). The GM must adjust the rolls based on character background.  
* Edouardo will **reward** them (see below), then everyone is asked to stand in the stairway for a count of 30\. Nothing is heard, but when they return he and his guard are gone.

### Denouement

* **Skull**:  
  * What happens to the **skull**? See [Black Relics](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ml4MhMjmapNTFYD-ifeZb_XncwotmAcRF9zSmtC7zb0/edit#bookmark=id.9txoukadh695) for details.  
* **Room**:  
  * Reading certain symbols (Diff 7\) on the tomb reveals a **Cypher**: "+2 Insight into the mind or designs of the corruptor." Reattempts after failure to read this cypher require a level increase. 

### Rewards

1. **Inscription**: Edouardo commends the players to visit the pavement before the altar upstairs and read the inscription there.  
     
   *"In the year of Christ one thousand two hundred and twelve plus sixty minus four, the third King Henry, the city, Odoricus and the abbot put these porphyry stones together.*  
     
   *If the reader wisely considers all that is laid down, he will find here the end of the primum mobile; a hedge (lives for) three years, add dogs and horses and men, stags and ravens, eagles, enormous whales, the world: each one following triples the years of the one before."*

   The first part is mere flourish, but the second part, if the PCs inquire, is a prediction of the date of the [end of the world](https://www.westminster-abbey.org/about-the-abbey/history/cosmati-pavement). Reading this inscription, at any time, grants a cypher.

   * **Cypher**: Essentially allowing a re-roll of any task, the recipient can see the future a moment ahead and change their action.

2. **Coin**: Each player is given a [Coin of Edward the Confessor](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ml4MhMjmapNTFYD-ifeZb_XncwotmAcRF9zSmtC7zb0/edit#bookmark=id.cn1lk3f966z7), to place under their tongue at need. See description for details.

\<Give Pre-Session Briefing\>

## **Accidents on the Way**

GM: What is to be done about breakfast?

While traveling London to reach the lab:

- Henton, reading about a woman named [Eleanor Saunders of Kennington](https://about1816.wordpress.com/2015/01/05/climate-change-and-millenarianism-1816-style/), distractedly slips down an outdoor staircase and breaks his thumb; hand inability  
- One PC, traveling with Henton, is hit by a carriage, which stops, and is bleeding and bruised. It brings up **old memories**. 1d6 speed loss  
- One PC is accosted by a man wailing about the ongoing suspension of Habeas Corpus, who accidentally knocks him into the Thames, ruining his clothes and papers: 1d4 int  
- One PC is bitten by a dog: 1d6 speed

## **Gift**

Upon arrival, a gift basket with wine and cheese will be present, from an antagonist of Henton's, congratulating him on what he hears from Oliver is magnificent work. "Jarvis Henson" \- advisor at graduate school.

* The cheese is poisoned with a lung-muscle paralytic obtained from the Red Monkey River Reed of the Volta river, on the Gold Coast: Stop breathing within 1 minute, then lose 1 might per round, until 3d4 total are lost

GM: Just as the first person eats the cheese, Oliver arrives "What? I haven't seen Henson in a month."

* Truth: Oliver hasn't seen the man, and of course it isn't from him at all  
* Roll 5 to trace each part,with bonus if you live nearby  
  * Wine \- a man in clothing of no nation bought it. It is an excellent vintage.  
  * Cheese \- two blue cheeses, pungent enough to hide a scent. Can't recall who bought it  
  * Basket \- yes, I sell those. It was a man with a scar on one cheek.  
  * Card paper \- yes, we press that ourselves. Not like that new fangled factory paper. Pah\! The man had a scar on his right cheek.

## **Coin Research**

Trying to decipher the writing on the coins creates a problem. See the [Coin Detail](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ml4MhMjmapNTFYD-ifeZb_XncwotmAcRF9zSmtC7zb0/edit#bookmark=id.cn1lk3f966z7).  
OR I might just let it be what it is. Nobody really knows what that writing means. EDARD REX perhaps the second word means Edward?

STRANGE LANGUAGE \- needs Brantwhistle Davington

## **Morgue Research**

Roll 5 to social your way in. William might identify his role. It is just a dead man, nothing unusual.

* If they check his pocket it has poison capsule  
* **Roll 3** to notice and remember the tread of his shoe

## **Skull Research**

Details on the [skull](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ml4MhMjmapNTFYD-ifeZb_XncwotmAcRF9zSmtC7zb0/edit#bookmark=id.9txoukadh695). [PIC](https://i.imgur.com/s9JgG3U.jpg)

- DONE Roll 4 to see that the piece proportions are different  
- DONE Roll 5 to interpret sigils in the skull's inset. In Batavian they say Darklands, Weightless, Unseen, Never, Victory  
- DONE Roll 5 to learn the eye gems have an African Ashanti origin. They smolder with dark power. Lapidary would help.  
- DONE Roll 5 to determine the skull is a Gelada, like the one recently brought to the Royal Menagerie. May seek menagerist and simian expert [Daniel Smythe](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ml4MhMjmapNTFYD-ifeZb_XncwotmAcRF9zSmtC7zb0/edit#bookmark=id.aicjjbaqg3f3). See "Missing" below.  
- they experiment however; they need British Museum access, or   
- Oxford is a two day trip away, but the best Asiatics expert is there  
- Assembly: Assembling all the pieces together only actually restores the skull to full function if you leave it that way for ten minutes  
- Assembly: Upon initial assembly, William is suddenly struck blind. Better see a brain doctor.

Conclusions

* It is Javanese, but overlaid with African Ashanti symbolism  
* The skull is a weird mix of cultures.

E*skeletons, ancient books, scrolls of many nations, samples of crystal and stone, phoenician bronze work, and even a pair of large, cracked stone tablets. Beyond the first set of shelves, a dim light is visible.*

GM: 

*Upon a carved wooden desk rests a lit candle and two open scrolls [PIC](https://brill.com/view/journals/arie/19/1/15700593_019_01_s003_i0008.png) and [PIC](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-PLTBn2omeME/UO8oQFbPJnI/AAAAAAAAAFE/MGVugAXuy9w/s1600/El+Shadai.jpg) with odd writing. There are blood droplets spilt on one of the scrolls, in patterns that almost look like some form of lettering*.

GM: If interpreted (Moira or Oliver might know), in Hebrew it reads

Scroll 1: *“If at a full moon you wish to seize and to bind a man and a woman \<blank area\>  To annul spirits and blast demons and satans, and to bind a boat, and to free a man from prison \<stained, smeared region\>. To see the aerie paths of the dark usurper of souls, black mist of the mouth, that most unholy and welcome in the fiery mountain, put fire to the wax and drip it upon thine eye and upon it write תובר תסבר* 

Scroll 2: *And if you wish to destroy high mountains and to pass  through the sea and the land, and to go down into fire and come up, and to remove kings, and to cause illusion, and to stop up a mouth, and to raise golems from the living clay, and to converse with the dead, and to kill the living, and to bring down and raise up and command angels to abide by you, and to learn all the secrets of the world – write on a silver plate, and grind the black bones of the overthrown, and in a root of artemisia, chanting those words to be found upon unredeemed blood.*

GM: Roll 3 to spot blood droplets upon the floor. There are other ways to find the trail.

*Blood droplets lead across the floor to a ring set in the wood. Opening it, you see a ladder leading down. It arrives in a basement room, damp, with rotting, improperly stored furniture. A shut and locked grating yields sounds of sloshing water and distant echoes.* 

*Lying upon the floor is a strangely dressed man with clothing of uncertain national origin. Red candle wax is upon his open eyes. Blood seeps between his lips. Unconscious, he lies with a peaceful, almost ecstatic expression on his face.*

GM: Investigations:

* DONE Roll 2 Open his mouth to see his tongue is cut up the middle, like a serpent.  
* DONE Roll 2 to find his knife, and the sigils thereon. Bloody finger.  
* FAIL Roll 7 To identify the sigils on his knife as Kaballah [PIC](https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJxz0Rum7gLkAuXwULmDaY_rn1SnW0Ej2Us5wg=s900-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo).  
* DONE Roll 6 to check his face for a plastic scar and wig. Asset if you have Disguise, or Acting. Asset if you have a bright light, or touch his face.  
* DONE Roll 4 to find, in a secret inner coat pocket near his butt, stage makeup. See Grimaldi for details.  
* DONE Roll 7 to identify [JS Grimaldi](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ml4MhMjmapNTFYD-ifeZb_XncwotmAcRF9zSmtC7zb0/edit#bookmark=id.zeyszvlll8t3), asset if you have seen farcical theatre, asset if you removed his scar or wig.

GM: If Grimaldi is tended he will awake in about an hour. He is corrupted, but claims no memory of the entire night. He says he drinks a lot and does heroin, so he loses days sometimes. He must return to Covent Garden to perform ith his father.

GM : if they attempt to arrest him the Charlie's will demand of them what are the charges. When they can't come up with any Moira will point out that habeas corpus is suspended and they don't need to charge him with anything or go in front of a judge to prove that he deserves to be in detention. When they wonder about this she will say that may not matter to people like you but it matters a lot to people like me.

GM: From there they need to **trace the path** of the skull by using Henton's second sight, or by using the hot wax magic on one of the scrolls.
