## PART 2
===============================

### To Westminster

On the way to Westminster the PCs are rather delayed.

They have at least two random encounters from the London Streets from the London Street Encounters table.

### Save the Abbot

When you arrive a service is in progress. A number of people sit in the forward pews, listening to a service. If you approach respectfully, there are spaces in the pews. A few people wander on the fringes, admiring the stonework. Numerous Irish are present, perhaps twenty, lighting candles for some of the hundred thousand dead from Typhus due to the strange Year without a Summer. Sitting on a pew together at the front are two black robed monks. One seems to have some level of rank, but it is unclear what. A priest stands in the pulpit above the monks and other congregants. The altar area stands empty, cordoned off with red velvet rope. PIC

**GM:** The PCs may act. As they act they will hear the following (summarize from this actual sermon). As they go, the sounds of the sermon drift to wherever they are.

**GM:** Pick the most kindly looking PC:  
A woman walks up to you. She is plainly dressed, clearly lower class, probably Irish. She seems on the younger side, but it is hard to tell her age because work in the sun and the cares of a difficult life have left their mark. Her eyes look red, as if she has been recently crying. With a very thick Irish accent she says, *"My name is Moira O'Connor. A pleasure to meet you."* and holds out her hand to shake. This is rather forward, more appropriate to a business deal than a greeting, and yet...

**GM:** If shake, she says, *"I will be assisting you today. What is my first task?"*

### Investigations

Visiting the altar is very improper. You may, but quickly you are shooed away by a priest, and the crowd glances scornfully at you. Persistent players get a visit from angry Irish candle-lighters.

**PREACH 1:**  
So says Romans 13:12: *"The night is far spent, the day is at hand: let us therefore cast off the works of darkness, and let us put on the Armor of Light. Let us walk honestly, as in the day."*

**GM:** Irish:  
An Irish woman candle-lighter, weeping, complains of a strange man knocking the candle from her hand. It was for her boy, dead of the Typhus these twelve days. She points to a man who furtively enters a door leading to the spiral stairs to the second level.

**PREACH 2:**  
These words herald the coming of the Lord, in his majesty, to judge the quick and the dead, in the final hours of existence, and none may escape that day. No king, no soldier, no tanner, no smith, for all shall be judged. Many are the signs and warnings which God has graciously given in his Holy Word, to the end that this great and terrible day, however it may overtake the world, may not overtake people unawares. The night is far spent!

**GM:** Agent:  
At some point a man dressed in garb of an unidentifiable country will be seen, chased into the spiral staircase between levels, and confronted. He will suicide with a pill if captured, freeing himself from overthrow just long enough for this:

The strange, dead-eyed man grips your lapel with white knuckles, a frothy foam bubbling from his lips. Suddenly looking into your eyes his gaze clears, and he seems to really see you for the first time. Pulling you towards him he gasps *"King David wore the fiery diamond of seven-starred Jupiter."*

**GM:** this refers to the star cluster on the Cosmati that is northwest of the center, with seven green-and-red stars of David. The one to the left of center has a redder arm, in diamond shape, that when pressed allows you to rotate the planet and reveal a compartment.

### PLOT 6

The priest descends from the elevated pulpit. The hooded figures turn such that you can see the front of their robes. They are not Italian Benedictines at all, but rather German Cistercians! Just at that moment, Reginald Jones hurries up to you, trying to be quiet and respectful but clearly upset and urgent. *"There is another Cosmati, in the crypt of Edward the Confessor! Oh my, I hope I haven't steered you wrong."*

* Players may guess where the crypt door is, or ask somebody. The Irish all know.

At the entrance to the staircase leading down to the tombs a single guard stands, wearing non-descript garments. He sports a dashing mustache, an immaculately cropped beard, and eyes that speak of long campaigns and hardship. A key hangs from his belt, and the unlocked door stands open, showing stairs descending to the crypts. Time is of the essence.

**GM:** Guard is a King's Guard. See the bestiary for details.

* Convince, confront, trick, disable, or slip past the guard. He may seem to submit to an overwhelming force, and take a hostage when arriving in Edward's tomb.
* If you charge, he enters the stairs and locks the gate (roll to see if he is fast enough)
* If you ask nicely, he will lock the gate and deliver a message, succumbing with his lord (a collapse and clatter will be heard)

**PREACH 3 – WHILE CONFRONTING GUARD:**  
Darkness yet struggles with light, pierced through as it retreats by the glittering shafts of the true King of Day. Long and weary was the night when heathen idolatry and superstition divided the world. Four ravening beasts Daniel saw coming up out of the sea, yet more beasts appear, and ever more. In their hand is the whip, and they drive the innocent before them. The day is at hand!

### TOMB

Entering a modest stone chamber, an elaborate rectangular tomb stands in the middle of the chamber. You see the Italian Benedictine Abbot kneeling before the tomb, bent over it intently, carefully examining or perhaps reading inscriptions upon the ancient metalwork. Suddenly he begins struggling to breathe. Something is happening. Everyone is suddenly overcome within their mind. A fist beats against your unconscious soul. What is happening?

* Roll 4 vs overthrow
* Roll 4 to see a black vapor, not a soul, seeping up from the Cosmati pavement.
* Roll to find a secret compartment accessed by pressing a certain stone, per the note found by Reginald. PIC  
  Applicable skills might include symbology, architecture, that sort of thing, difficulty 5.
  * Cypher: Divine the contents of a case, compartment, or bag.
* Compartment: Within the hidden compartment is the blackened skull of a monkey inset with bronze. PIC. Black veins creep across its surface, ever in motion.
* Read next Preach, then
* Skull resolution:
  * see Black Relics for powers and how to disable
  * Carrying Edouardo out works, but the skull will follow, hovering, and overthrow the guard or a nearby altar boy.

**PREACH 4 – AS SKULL IS DISCOVERED:**  
Our globe-spanning empire finds the beasts in their depredations. They must be delivered! Ever subtle are the works of evil. Let the lord guide our hands! Let us cast off the works of darkness!

**PREACH 5 – AFTER FIRST FAILED ATTEMPT, OR ON SUCCESS:**  
Thessalonians says, *"Let us, who are of the day, be sober, putting on the breastplate of faith and love, and for a helmet the hope of salvation."* God bless the prince regent George. Let his instrument of Empire cleanse the wicked of the world, and all who hear these words: You are of the day, and must do the works of the day. Put on the armor of light!

**GM:** If he goes too many rounds without being rescued, he falls on his back and his arms start to cross over his chest.

* His face: Now after, you can see the face of the abbot more clearly. PIC

### MEETING

Relief shows on the face of the black-robed abbot. Lifting his head, he speaks with a flawless upper class English tone:

*"Your intervention is most welcome. I am Abbot Edouardo of the Sicilian Benedictines, and you have saved my mind from overthrow. You have performed a great service for the Empire, and I will be certain the best people learn of your deed. Let me thank you, and then I must urgently depart."*

* Roll DC 5–8 to recognize him as His Royal Highness Prince Regent George IV (NPC). The GM must adjust the rolls based on character background.
* Edouardo will reward them (see below), then everyone is asked to stand in the stairway for a count of 30. Nothing is heard, but when they return he and his guard are gone.

### Denouement

* Skull:
  * What happens to the skull? See Black Relics for details.
* Room:
  * Reading certain symbols (Diff 7) on the tomb reveals a Cypher: *"+2 Insight into the mind or designs of the corruptor."* Reattempts after failure to read this cypher require a level increase.

### Rewards

1. **Inscription:**  
   Edouardo commends the players to visit the pavement before the altar upstairs and read the inscription there.

   > "In the year of Christ one thousand two hundred and twelve plus sixty minus four, the third King Henry, the city, Odoricus and the abbot put these porphyry stones together.
   >
   > If the reader wisely considers all that is laid down, he will find here the end of the primum mobile; a hedge (lives for) three years, add dogs and horses and men, stags and ravens, eagles, enormous whales, the world: each one following triples the years of the one before."

   The first part is mere flourish, but the second part, if the PCs inquire, is a prediction of the date of the end of the world. Reading this inscription, at any time, grants a cypher.

   * Cypher: Essentially allowing a re-roll of any task, the recipient can see the future a moment ahead and change their action.

2. **Coin:**  
   Each player is given a Coin of Edward the Confessor, to place under their tongue at need. See description for details.
