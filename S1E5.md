# Part 4 \=======

\<Give Pre-Session Briefing\>

## **Missing**

At dinner, breakfast, or waiting at the entrance to the Menagerie to see Daniel:

GM: If at the menagerie, at the entrance, a young street boy gives over a dog to the entrance minder. *"His Royal Highness Leo the Lion will be glad of this dog\! Thank you young sir. You and your sister may enter now."* The dog is to be fed to the lion. This is a valid form of entrance.

*Have you heard? It is rather mysterious. Well, there is a new monkey exhibit at the menagerie. Wanted to bring my kids to that exhibit\! Monkeys are so silly, my little Dorothy always claps for their antics. Big holdup though.*

*You might have heard about the menagerist, Daniel Smythe? His wife Clarissa and two children have gone missing. It isn't proper what she has had to endure. Smythe acquired a snake from Africa last year, but it fell to Clarissa to tend the cursed thing. Well, it bit her\! Turned a white streak through her hair. Solid white from the temple back\! Still a beauty though.*

*And now gone\! Delayed the baboon exhibit\!*

**Roll 4** to have met them.

## **Stolen\!**

Wherever the skull is kept the following night, it is **stolen**. **Clues** can be found with roleplay and with abilities such as Lab Analysis:

* Fingerprints don't exist as a forensic method  
* Witness: A fishwife saw a man with clothing "like some foreigner" "lurking about"  
* Witness: A street urchin saw a dog jump through a high window and turn into a man (lie)  
* Evidence: A tobacco leaf on the floor indicates a smoker; pipe weed  
* Evidence: A muddy shoe print, and trail  
* Investigate: Finding the shoe maker he relates a strange man came and paid with half a Spanish gold doubloon. If he goes to find it, it is a lead coin without a face.  
* Tracking: A muddy shoe print enables tracking to the sewers  
* Rat footprints also surround the table (he just has rats)

## **Tracking**

Initially the skull is taken with footprints to the British museum.

*Arriving at the museum the first thing you notice is the scaffolding and construction.* [PIC](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/92/P8282318.1.JPG) *The advance of Empire is bringing the world to Britain's doorstep, and the current museum and library is packed to overflowing. The already-open sections are an island of clam, compared to the enormous rollers and cranes being used to hoist the Elder Memnon.* [PIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Younger_Memnon#/media/File:Memnonre.jpg)

*However, your trail leads you towards the elder museum at Montagu House, where the greatest treasures and ancient tomes are kept.* [PIC](https://c7.alamy.com/comp/W7DTKN/british-museum-london-c1810artist-sands-W7DTKN.jpg)

GM: Entry is "free to all studious and curious persons", but there is a secretary guarding entrance to the inner library. Officious. Bloated with power.

*You reach the sanctum of the library [PIC](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/77/bb/d8/77bbd851dac78540fdf7430ab2a55a83.jpg), richly paneled with mahogany wainscotting. Two men are present, Jarvis [PIC](https://www.geographicus.com/mm5/cartographers/colleschristopher.jpg) and the Great Giovanni Belzoni [PIC](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/96/Giovanni_Battista_Belzoni_by_William_Brockedon.jpg/800px-Giovanni_Battista_Belzoni_by_William_Brockedon.jpg). "I say, what is the meaning of this?" says \<person\>.*

GM: They have to figure out some way to get in and get past someone who disapproves of Henton and at the same time past the professor that has always humiliated William. Social Conflict.

*Specimens of many kinds rest on the racks of shelves in this dim, dry, dusty room. Animal skeletons, ancient books, scrolls of many nations, samples of crystal and stone, phoenician bronze work, and even a pair of large, cracked stone tablets. Beyond the first set of shelves, a dim light is visible.*

GM: 

*Upon a carved wooden desk rests a lit candle and two open scrolls [PIC](https://brill.com/view/journals/arie/19/1/15700593_019_01_s003_i0008.png) and [PIC](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-PLTBn2omeME/UO8oQFbPJnI/AAAAAAAAAFE/MGVugAXuy9w/s1600/El+Shadai.jpg) with odd writing. There are blood droplets spilt on one of the scrolls, in patterns that almost look like some form of lettering*.

GM: If interpreted (Moira or Oliver might know), in Hebrew it reads

Scroll 1: *“If at a full moon you wish to seize and to bind a man and a woman \<blank area\>  To annul spirits and blast demons and satans, and to bind a boat, and to free a man from prison \<stained, smeared region\>. To see the aerie paths of the dark usurper of souls, black mist of the mouth, that most unholy and welcome in the fiery mountain, put fire to the wax and drip it upon thine eye and upon it write תובר תסבר* 

Scroll 2: *And if you wish to destroy high mountains and to pass  through the sea and the land, and to go down into fire and come up, and to remove kings, and to cause illusion, and to stop up a mouth, and to raise golems from the living clay, and to converse with the dead, and to kill the living, and to bring down and raise up and command angels to abide by you, and to learn all the secrets of the world – write on a silver plate, and grind the black bones of the overthrown, and in a root of artemisia, chanting those words to be found upon unredeemed blood.*

GM: Roll 3 to spot blood droplets upon the floor. There are other ways to find the trail.

*Blood droplets lead across the floor to a ring set in the wood. Opening it, you see a ladder leading down. It arrives in a basement room, damp, with rotting, improperly stored furniture. A shut and locked grating yields sounds of sloshing water and distant echoes.* 

*Lying upon the floor is a strangely dressed man with clothing of uncertain national origin. Red candle wax is upon his open eyes. Blood seeps between his lips. Unconscious, he lies with a peaceful, almost ecstatic expression on his face.*

GM: Investigations:

* DONE Roll 2 Open his mouth to see his tongue is cut up the middle, like a serpent.  
* DONE Roll 2 to find his knife, and the sigils thereon. Bloody finger.  
* FAIL Roll 7 To identify the sigils on his knife as Kaballah [PIC](https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJxz0Rum7gLkAuXwULmDaY_rn1SnW0Ej2Us5wg=s900-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo).  
* DONE Roll 6 to check his face for a plastic scar and wig. Asset if you have Disguise, or Acting. Asset if you have a bright light, or touch his face.  
* DONE Roll 4 to find, in a secret inner coat pocket near his butt, stage makeup. See Grimaldi for details.  
* DONE Roll 7 to identify [JS Grimaldi](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ml4MhMjmapNTFYD-ifeZb_XncwotmAcRF9zSmtC7zb0/edit#bookmark=id.zeyszvlll8t3), asset if you have seen farcical theatre, asset if you removed his scar or wig.

GM: If Grimaldi is tended he will awake in about an hour. He is corrupted, but claims no memory of the entire night. He says he drinks a lot and does heroin, so he loses days sometimes. He must return to Covent Garden to perform ith his father.

GM : if they attempt to arrest him the Charlie's will demand of them what are the charges. When they can't come up with any Moira will point out that habeas corpus is suspended and they don't need to charge him with anything or go in front of a judge to prove that he deserves to be in detention. When they wonder about this she will say that may not matter to people like you but it matters a lot to people like me.

GM: From there they need to **trace the path** of the skull by using Henton's second sight, or by using the hot wax magic on one of the scrolls.

# PART 5 \==============

\<Pre-Session Briefing\>

## **Found Man**

GM: Connecting everyone

* Gelada preview: [Video1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDH96I7TDT4&t=1m4s), [Video2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDH96I7TDT4&t=2m6s)  
* **Daniel** wakes to find **Gahan**. Neither know that Daniel's whole family is missing.  
* Return to the **menagerie** to find that the **6 geladas are missing**, but the rusted sewer grate in their cage is torn out.  
* Calls on **Phil's character**, a resourceful friend, to help retrieve them.  
* Pays **Gahan** to accompany.  
* Bring along **Oil Lamps** and **Beast Nabbers** \- long poles with a cat-gut loop at the end.  
* Bring along **Barnard** the menagerie assistant.  
* Down they go, in a moment they all begin to slip in the slime of the sewer floor, and all slide to the bottom.

## **Sewers**

**Henton** \- focus on dark spirits to track; he can try hard, and glimpse which way it went at a turning point, costing 1 Int.  
**Bolton** \- memorize sewer layout to know what is above, as assets

The trail (intentionally) leads to sewers, attempting to lead them to deadly places. Smell: dank drainage:

### Quicksand

GM: Establish **marching order**

* A place where the muck is soft like **quicksand**. **Smell: mud**. One needs a tosher's hoe, survival, faithful friends, or some luck, to avoid suffocating. Everyone will realize too late.  
* Here two **foxes**, freshly drowned, float in the water. **Roll 2** as a Naturalist to collect scent glands.

### Collapsed area

*A collapse in the wall of the sewer reveals a shallow, cave-like area. Sticking out of the muck are what appear to be straight, gray and blackened sticks, and dirty white cobbles. There is a smell of rotting flesh. A fragment of mosaic is barely visible. Deeper in the hollow, something glints.*

GM: Who enters?

*Entering the hollow, the mosaic becomes clear. [PIC](https://www.guardian-series.co.uk/resources/images/11424664.jpg?display=1&htype=0&type=responsive-gallery) You approach the glint. It is some kind of carved, translucent, purplish stone. As you examine it more closely, you realize that the gray and black sticks you observed are bones, and the whitish cobble a skull.*

GM: **Roll 6** against bad luck until one person fails. A black bone shard pierces their calf, doing 8 speed, and hindering use of legs. It remains in the leg. **Roll 3** to yank it out. It feels like a sliver remains.

GM: **Roll 6** to identify the [intaglio of Caracalla](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ml4MhMjmapNTFYD-ifeZb_XncwotmAcRF9zSmtC7zb0/edit#bookmark=id.h7ng8m5h4z1c), [PIC](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Intaglio_Caracalla_Cdm_Paris_Chab2101.jpg/300px-Intaglio_Caracalla_Cdm_Paris_Chab2101.jpg) an impressive specimen of glyptic art. No powers, just immense archaeological value. The collapse is a Roman crypt, to which one may return, but the black bones are corrupted Nerossia bringing bad luck.

GM: **Antitox** moss [LINK](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ml4MhMjmapNTFYD-ifeZb_XncwotmAcRF9zSmtC7zb0/edit#bookmark=id.m0fmuo4meiun): *A somewhat slimy, mottled, green and violet moss grows on the walls. It smells like charcoal.* Identified by Naturalist **Roll 4**.

## **Menagerie**

*This section of sewer begins to smell of hay and animals. Drifting from narrow openings above, sounds of people strolling, children laughing and an occasional bellow as of a lion or the chuffing sound of an ibex. You must be below the Royal Menagerie kept near the Tower of London.*

**Main group**: A steep tunnel intersects your path. There are lights coming from a side passage.  
**Nabber group**: You hear something ahead. Better get the Nabbers ready\!

## **Rats**

*As the stone ceiling descends a bit, the water rises to your belly. The scent of sewer fades as the smell of blood and fresh carcasses rises in your nostrils. Faintly from above you hear something being wrapped in wax paper. The words "That will be two and seven ma'am." are accompanied by the thud of cleavers severing flesh. You see a faint glint of light above, which vanishes as the sound of something wet and sloppy begins. You smell offal as the wet sound approaches from above.*

GM: **Roll 3** to avoid the pig guts.

*You hear high pitched squeaking as, from a high hole in the wall, a mischief of rats scurries. Attracted by the offal, no doubt, they ignore you and run down the walls towards the strong-smelling entrails. Looking down, you realize that you are standing in the day's discards from the butcher shop above, more than belly deep. From another hole more rats emerge, and another. They swarm the entrails, emitting shrieks of excitement.*

GM: What do they do? Over 2 rounds a rat swarm will overwhelm the group, gnawing on their clothes and flesh. Movement through the belly-deep water is achingly slow.

GM: \<PC1\> feels a bite. (wait) \<PC2\> feels a bite. (wait) The tunnel erupts in shouting as the rats start to gnaw into clothing and flesh.

Escaping  
Escape in **4 rounds** through the belly-deep water

* **Marching order matters**. At least one of the two people on the end must move for you to move. The tunnel is 2 people wide.  
* **Roll 4** to sour the entrails (eg with alcohol), decreasing the rats and **easing all rolls**.  
* **Fox Scent** will disperse the rats for 2 rounds.  
* **Diving** under water is possible, but **light will be doused**. The **rats will depart** in another round, and you will only be rattled for **1 Int**.  
* **Pushing** past another person roll opposed. If success, the pushee loses their next turn.

Each Round  
Maybe make a single roll, then apply skills etc to hit your number?

* **Roll 7** (agility) or suffer **1 Might** damage per round.  
* **Roll 6** (agility) not to drop each light. Becoming lightless hinders willpower rolls.  
* **Roll 5** (willpower) each round or become rattled for **2 Int**   
  * On **1** panic and push past someone (as above).  
  * On **2, 3** panic and lose your action.  
  * On **1-4** start **screaming** until you roll 5 vs being rattled.

## **Macadamia Periwinkle**

GM: If somebody screams, or drops a light, this happens:

* Just **down the tunnel** in the direction they're going, the ruckus attracts [**Macadamia**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ml4MhMjmapNTFYD-ifeZb_XncwotmAcRF9zSmtC7zb0/edit#bookmark=id.ctnl4y8gv2t) to a narrow grate in the wall. He can't touch you, but you could reach to pass objects. "*A face peers through a narrow grate in the wall. "Who goes there, a-disturbin' my work? If ye be howlin' spirits avert\! But if men speak your piece\!*"  
* The man holds a candle to your face. *"Sir\! You look right baked\!"* (exhausted)  
* *You notice that he has set a kind of fishing rod strung with found teacups, some chipped, and a many with decoration rubbed off, to lean up against the nearby wall \- apparently his find of the day.*  
* He says "*Adzooks\! What are you doing over there? Only an addle pate goes to the rat side, if you'll forgive my sayin'. Not that we could if we would, for we can't, so we won't. That is to say, not a body knows how to reach them tunnels you're in\! Besides that's rat territory, and we don't want truck with no rats.*"  
* Expresses **skepticism** \- are they trying to become Toshers? Moving in on his territory?  
* Can **replace their lights** with two candles, flint and steel. *"Now, don't be a great gollumpus and dowse those again. And get clean of those tunnels\!"*

## **Tea Time**

GM: While speaking with Macadamia, the **church bells chime four**. He will offer them cups he just found. *"Join me for some prattle-broth, will ye? I can't offer but a crust and some cheese"*

GM: Tea provides a rest break to regain **3 Int**. It will also heal **2 Might**.

# PART 6 \==============

\<Pre-game briefing\>

* Mark off the rests taken  
* X How many rests had Constance already taken?  
* X Hauser roll d20 to determine how Constance did with rats: worse means injured like the worst injured party member, and best means uninjured.  
* X Constance: You remember about Daniel's disappearance; do you mention his wife or kids?  
* X Anyone with an object harmed by water, it is at risk  
* X Describe how your character looks after the encounter.  
* X Inventory the lights held by the party.  
* X Resolve how many oil lamps are retrieved, and whether Macadamia helps (see above)  
* X William \- how do you know Richard Trevithick, genius steam inventor?  
* Resume talking to Macadamia.

## **High Grating**

*The sewer pipe angles slowly upward, wide enough for two men abreast. The floor flattens and the top of the passage becomes an arch. Keystones are present at the apex of the low ceiling. Above, a trick of the piping makes the sounds of the street reassuringly near. Horses clip clop past, and the clack of men's boots with iron clad heels echoes from above. Those passers by are living their ordinary life, doing every-day tasks in the warm sunshine of a July London day.* 

GM: **Roll 3** archaeology to know that this is a Roman passage design.

Farnsworth Bigglestone passes by \- *this just isn't proper. Not proper at all\!*

## **Cistern**

GM: Through a collapsed wall:  *A wall has collapsed, to your right, a narrow, straight passage with flat floor, walls and a peaked ceiling proceeds. It leads to a staircase of stone, leading down perhaps 20 feet. The stone stairs are covered in a thick carpet of moss.*

GM: **Roll 3** flora to know this is an edible moss typical of the Scottish highlands, prized for feeding to sheep.

*In a moment the echoes of your footsteps change, and your feeble lights no longer reach the walls. A single column rises up ahead of you. The ceiling is in shadow, but a dim light strikes one part of the room from above. There, you see that the room must be filled with ranks of tall columns, rough with age, with arched ceilings between each and stiff posts between every arch. The floor is damp stone.*

GM: **Roll 4** to determine it is an ancient Roman cistern, long lost.

*Silhouetted ahead you can just barely make out a huge carved head, squared off on the top, lying sideways in the water. There is a faint sound ahead.*  [PIC](https://i.imgur.com/bSwsnOj.jpg), [PIC](https://images1.westend61.de/0001404338pw/turkey-istanbul-head-of-medusa-inside-basilica-cistern-ABOF00531.jpg)

GM: Head is a medusa.The carving and detail is exquisite, even after all these years.

GM: **Roll 3** archaeology to remember that the snakes on these heads were carved in such a way that light cast upon them makes the snakes look remarkably life-like and real. Intimidating. Now that you mention it, everyone can clearly see it. A light from above does the trick.

*Near a column with another strange head at the base, a strange inhuman mewling, almost like a baby crying, echoes. It is not a comfortable sound. [SOUND](https://youtu.be/lBiwsEIcxMI) There is a tang of urine in the air and, drifting from somewhere, a putrid stench of rot.*

GM: Explore room for a bit. Who comforts Daniel?

GM: **Roll High** discovers baboon kids. *The sound emanates from two forms no bigger than a child. As the light draws near, you can see two gelada baboon juveniles no bigger than a grammar school child. They cower and duck their heads, avoiding the light. They look sad and pitiful, sitting in the brownish water. One reflexively grooms the other, grabbing nits and chewing them.*

*Looking up at a sudden noise, your lights reflect two red points of reflected light. Eyes. Screaming a warning, a huge, full grown female gelada with a **white streak of hair** leaps from the ancient pipes above, interposing herself between the young geladas and your group. [PIC MOTHER](https://i.imgur.com/WdtEr1W.jpg)  On a ledge nearby another gelada, a male, sits watching calmly. [PIC MALE](https://i.imgur.com/gZrNHLI.png)*

GM: Mention the white streak a few times. PCs might back away, or whatever. The white streaked gelada looks more and more agitated.

GM: **Roll 3** if you have animal skills or biology, to understand the intent of the mother. If you succeed, you also gain an asset for all defense rolls vs. geladas for the duration of the encounter. 

*Daniel says, "Those are mine\!" as if there might be some other source of geladas supplying the long lost cisterns of London. "But this makes no sense. There are three gelada males and one female. Where did these juveniles come from? Where are the other males? Remember, these are all property of the crown\! Now let us get about catching them."*

GM: PC notices skull sitting on a high pipe. You can climb to it, shoot it, throw rocks, etc but there is deflection. At the same time, you see that the male gelada is gone into the darkness.

## **Situation**

The dead female monkey that his wife replaced will only be found later and then people will have the opportunity to figure it out, or that did monkey could be found if the party starts to threaten his wife

Idea: Skull causes ceiling stones unluckily to slide out and crash to the floor. It could be attributed to the monkeys, bu7t...

NOTE: **Progress rolls** you must hit the number X times.

* Failing the roll means to don't progress.  
* R1 means you must restart  
* R19 gives 2x progress  
* R20 means "done"

## **Battle**

* **Mom** defends kids; nab her nervously. Then kids.  
* **Daniel**: *"this isn't right. Did I hit my head so hard I don't remember?" Barney: "I never saw them, sir."*  
* **Dad** seen on ledge. Must climb towards light to reach him, but he will simply move away.  
* **Climb** up towards light for dad. Danger sense.  
* **Corpse** \- somebody finds corpse of female.  
* **Skull** seen at **T3**. Fall on next.  
  1. All **roll i5** vs overthrow. (Const \-2, Hent have \-1)  
* **Monkeys** from above "*A whooshing sound is accompanied by dark shapes hurtling from above."* [PIC](https://i.imgur.com/WZvF2Au.jpg)  
  1. Medusa heads scare the monkeys. Stand on them to avoid water. Space for 1\.  
  2. Monkey nab/abate; strike, back-off, strike, back-off  
* Objective: Must nab all and escape, hopefully after smashing skull.

**Notes:**

* **Skull**: Unobtainable until weakened by nightmare resolution. Will slip and roll, be carried by monkey (then put down). **Always** lose the jaw.  
  * **Deflects** all missiles .  
  * **Bad Luck** to any who grab it  
  * **Monkey** will grab it if it is threatened  
  * **Nab** \- from T3 or MS2 (but see bad luck).  
* **Dam**: Hold back chest-deep water. Hinders monkeys on ground due to height; but once deep enough, they swim faster than humans  
  1. Rnd 1-2 Shin deep \- PCs move fine, Geladas hindered  
  2. Rnd 3-4 Thigh deep \- PCs hindered; Geladas swim  
  3. Rnd 5-6 Belly deep \- PCs 14 speed, Geladas swim  
* **Ledge** L requires four rounds of success to reach it.   
1. **Roll 3** to climb a canted 30 degree column  
2. **Roll 4** to climb a cracked vertical column, reaching a pipe  
3. **Roll 3** to braciate and drop on top of a tall column missing its top 10% pipe  
4. **Roll 2** to brachiate to the ledge  
* **Light** \- you get Ease on from-above attacks.  
* **Water** \- is shin deep, but murky. Has hidden potholes that will dunk a PC.  
* **R1** \- has oil on ground and up column. Light it to brighten area,   
* **R1-3** \- roll these upon nabbers & chock them to keep monkeys.

## **Overthrow Nightmares**

Those overthrown will imagine meeting a person they fear, in a situation they hate.

Upon entry to the Nightmare, each hears **"You feel you must get out of this situation, somehow."** Travel to elsewhere never works.

Results:

* Rebuff the person with in-character words and a good roll \- released.  
* Try a lateral-thinking solution \- released and restore full Int.  
* Use violence of any kind, or treat someone poorly \- hindered more and more.

Characters:

* **Bolton** meets **Admiral Cockburn** on the bridge of a ship, with fog all around. A silent pilot steers the ship, glancing at him sideways with a smirk. Cockburn shoves his bland dismissal in his face and tells him he is a complete mess unbecoming an officer. His uniform is a complete mess. There are sponges, brushes, shoeshine, a sink. No matter how he tries to fix it, the uniform never gets any better. Goal: escape the situation, including removing the uniform. Deciding how is the character's decision.  
* **Constance** meets **Father Kensington**, a poorhouse priest who remembers her, and asks whether, for all her seeming advancements, isn't she still just that little urchin full of anger. Lady Margaret sits with her back to Constance, no matter how Constance tries to get to her front. Any alley she runs down she ends up back at Kensington. Crosses come from above and strike her. She must grab Kensington's own cross from around his neck. What she does with it is a character decision.  
* **William** meets **Richard Trevithick**. On a steaming locomotive, with a coal car and ten tons of iron rods. A dwarf shovels coal wordlessly into a fire. Trevithick starts asking him how it works, and belittling him for not knowing the answers. They are going faster and faster. Trevithick forces coal into his mouth for each wrong answer. Cornishman Richard Trevithick’s ‘Pen-y-Darren’ locomotive carried ten tons of iron, five wagons and seventy men the 9.75 miles from the ironworks at Penydarren to the Merthyr-Cardiff Canal in four hours and five minutes. The journey had an average speed of c. 2.4 mph.  
* **Henton** is with **Jarvis** in the British Museum's inmost sanctum storage room, with unbelievably precious artifacts all around. They begin to topple. Jarvis sits on top of a wardrobe shouting at him to save the artifacts, and berating him "oh\! It must be spirits\! Fool." Every time Henton catches one, he drops it when he tries to save the next one.  
* **Gahan** meets Streaky, but his face is painted white like a clown. Streaky keeps picking his pocket no matter what he does. Old Farm is there, and keeps slapping him every time he tries something. There is an apple cart, and an apple seller singing a new verse of Hot Codlins each time it is Gahan's turn.

## **Climax**

Once the skull is obtained it will also use a Dramatic Mishap, such as:

* A church tower bell plummets entirely through the ceiling  
* A huge water release is poorly timed and washes the heroes away  
* An underwater metal snags pants  
* Sudden misfooting makes a slip and fall

## **Denouement**

* Jaw will later be found near the skull, as if it was creeping towards it.

Obsidian Portal \- get "ascendant"

Farnsworth Bigglestone passes by \- *this just isn't proper. Not proper at all\!*

\*\* What happens with that body? Does the Alien Office or Benedictines get involved?  
\* Inquest? who claims the body? It is at the morgue; the  
\* Coins \- what is the language around the edges.

\-\> XP \- make it so that there is plenty to burn.  
\-\> GM Intrusions \- 4x per night

To DO: Figure out what **Black Spirit Traumas** are.

A little old woman a living she got,

By selling hot codlins, hot\! hot\! hot\!

And this little old woman who codlins sold,

Though her codlins were hot, thought she felt herself cold,

So to keep herself warm, she thought it no sin,

To fetch for herself a quartern of — Ri, tol, lol, \&c.

This little old woman set off in a trot,

To fetch her a quartern of hot\! hot\! Hot\!

She swallowed one glass, and it was so nice,

She tipp'd off another in a trice;

The glass she fill'd till the bottle shrunk,

And this little woman they say got — Ri, tol, lol, \&c.

This little old woman, while muzzy she got,

Some boys stole her codlins, hot\! hot\! hot\!

Powder under her pan put, and in it some stones, \[usually: "round stones"\]

Says the little old woman, "these apples have bones\!"

The powder the pan in her face did send,

Which sent the old woman on her latter — Ri, tol, lol, \&c.

The little old woman then up she got,

All in a fury, hot\! hot\! Hot\!

Says she, "Such boys, sure, never were known,

They never will let an old woman alone."

Now here is my moral, around let it buz —

If you wish to sell codlins, never get \[muzzed\]
