## Part 4

<Give Pre-Session Briefing>

### Missing

At dinner, breakfast, or waiting at the entrance to the Menagerie to see Daniel:

**GM:** If at the menagerie, at the entrance, a young street boy gives over a dog to the entrance minder. *"His Royal Highness Leo the Lion will be glad of this dog! Thank you young sir. You and your sister may enter now."* The dog is to be fed to the lion. This is a valid form of entrance.

Have you heard? It is rather mysterious. Well, there is a new monkey exhibit at the menagerie. Wanted to bring my kids to that exhibit! Monkeys are so silly, my little Dorothy always claps for their antics. Big holdup though.

You might have heard about the menagerist, Daniel Smythe? His wife Clarissa and two children have gone missing. It isn't proper what she has had to endure. Smythe acquired a snake from Africa last year, but it fell to Clarissa to tend the cursed thing. Well, it bit her! Turned a white streak through her hair. Solid white from the temple back! Still a beauty though.

And now gone! Delayed the baboon exhibit!

* Roll 4 to have met them.

### Stolen!

Wherever the skull is kept the following night, it is stolen. Clues can be found with roleplay and with abilities such as Lab Analysis:

* Fingerprints don't exist as a forensic method
* Witness: A fishwife saw a man with clothing *"like some foreigner"* *"lurking about"*
* Witness: A street urchin saw a dog jump through a high window and turn into a man (lie)
* Evidence: A tobacco leaf on the floor indicates a smoker; pipe weed
* Evidence: A muddy shoe print, and trail
* Investigate: Finding the shoe maker he relates a strange man came and paid with half a Spanish gold doubloon. If he goes to find it, it is a lead coin without a face.
* Tracking: A muddy shoe print enables tracking to the sewers
* Rat footprints also surround the table (he just has rats)

### Tracking

Initially the skull is taken with footprints to the British museum.

Arriving at the museum the first thing you notice is the scaffolding and construction. PIC The advance of Empire is bringing the world to Britain's doorstep, and the current museum and library is packed to overflowing. The already-open sections are an island of calm, compared to the enormous rollers and cranes being used to hoist the Elder Memnon. PIC

However, your trail leads you towards the elder museum at Montagu House, where the greatest treasures and ancient tomes are kept. PIC

**GM:** Entry is *"free to all studious and curious persons"*, but there is a secretary guarding entrance to the inner library. Officious. Bloated with power.

You reach the sanctum of the library PIC, richly paneled with mahogany wainscotting. Two men are present, Jarvis PIC and the Great Giovanni Belzoni PIC. *"I say, what is the meaning of this?"* says <person>.

**GM:** They have to figure out some way to get in and get past someone who disapproves of Henton and at the same time past the professor that has always humiliated William. Social Conflict.

Specimens of many kinds rest on the racks of shelves in this dim, dry, dusty room. Animal skeletons, ancient books, scrolls of many nations, samples of crystal and stone, phoenician bronze work, and even a pair of large, cracked stone tablets. Beyond the first set of shelves, a dim light is visible.

**GM:**

Upon a carved wooden desk rests a lit candle and two open scrolls PIC and PIC with odd writing. There are blood droplets spilt on one of the scrolls, in patterns that almost look like some form of lettering.

**GM:** If interpreted (Moira or Oliver might know), in Hebrew it reads

**Scroll 1:**  
“If at a full moon you wish to seize and to bind a man and a woman <blank area> To annul spirits and blast demons and satans, and to bind a boat, and to free a man from prison <stained, smeared region>. To see the aerie paths of the dark usurper of souls, black mist of the mouth, that most unholy and welcome in the fiery mountain, put fire to the wax and drip it upon thine eye and upon it write תובר תסבר

**Scroll 2:**  
And if you wish to destroy high mountains and to pass through the sea and the land, and to go down into fire and come up, and to remove kings, and to cause illusion, and to stop up a mouth, and to raise golems from the living clay, and to converse with the dead, and to kill the living, and to bring down and raise up and command angels to abide by you, and to learn all the secrets of the world – write on a silver plate, and grind the black bones of the overthrown, and in a root of artemisia, chanting those words to be found upon unredeemed blood.

**GM:** Roll 3 to spot blood droplets upon the floor. There are other ways to find the trail.

Blood droplets lead across the floor to a ring set in the wood. Opening it, you see a ladder leading down. It arrives in a basement room, damp, with rotting, improperly stored furniture. A shut and locked grating yields sounds of sloshing water and distant echoes.

Lying upon the floor is a strangely dressed man with clothing of uncertain national origin. Red candle wax is upon his open eyes. Blood seeps between his lips. Unconscious, he lies with a peaceful, almost ecstatic expression on his face.

**GM: Investigations**
* DONE Roll 2 Open his mouth to see his tongue is cut up the middle, like a serpent.
* DONE Roll 2 to find his knife, and the sigils thereon. Bloody finger.
* FAIL Roll 7 To identify the sigils on his knife as Kaballah PIC.
* DONE Roll 6 to check his face for a plastic scar and wig. Asset if you have Disguise, or Acting. Asset if you have a bright light, or touch his face.
* DONE Roll 4 to find, in a secret inner coat pocket near his butt, stage makeup. See Grimaldi for details.
* DONE Roll 7 to identify JS Grimaldi, asset if you have seen farcical theatre, asset if you removed his scar or wig.

**GM:** If Grimaldi is tended he will awake in about an hour. He is corrupted, but claims no memory of the entire night. He says he drinks a lot and does heroin, so he loses days sometimes. He must return to Covent Garden to perform with his father.

**GM:** If they attempt to arrest him the Charlie's will demand of them what are the charges. When they can't come up with any Moira will point out that habeas corpus is suspended and they don't need to charge him with anything or go in front of a judge to prove that he deserves to be in detention. When they wonder about this she will say that may not matter to people like you but it matters a lot to people like me.

**GM:** From there they need to trace the path of the skull by using Henton's second sight, or by using the hot wax magic on one
