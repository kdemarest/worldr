### Events

*We are neither military, nor merchant, nor privateer. Yet, we are all of these things. We must adapt and overcome, gentlemen, and you shall better know what I mean when you see our ship. Let us get to know each other, then dine. after, we shall visit the ship briefly, and then retire here for some entertainment.*

Small talk:

* **Harvey** has seen action in the Navy repelling slave ships with the West Africa Patrol along the Gold Coast, in the war of 1812 at the Battle of Baltimore, and as a King's Privateer in the Caribbean. His experience in the hotter latitudes and his resourcefulness helped him get this position. He was commanded into it by Admiral Cochrane. **Was Cochrane right to enlist the freed slaves to fight?**  
* **Beard** wants to win the £5,000 for the navigator that could sail within a degree of latitude of the [North Pole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Pole) from the British [*Commissioners for the discovery of longitude at sea*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Board_of_Longitude). **Who has stories of great seamanship?**  
* **Zadkiel** talks of Almanacs, and prediction. He dismisses tarot as hogwash, but thinks there might be some merit in crystal balls. He talks of how his will become great, showing a visionary page. [PIC1](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2803/6230/products/57_6254e613-484d-40ff-a8f5-059789551461_1024x1024@2x.jpg?v=1571712496) [PIC2](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2803/6230/products/57_1495279d-e496-4193-b1fe-e96599079b4b_1024x1024@2x.jpg?v=1571712496) **Do you think prediction is real?**  
* **Merryweather** talks about the price of wheat.

Roles:

* Current Roles:  
  * Captain overall command  
  * Navigator use the sextant and the   
  * Weatherman \- not a position you've heard of before  
  * Quartermaster \-   
* Harvey presents Beard with an high precision hourglass: Hourglasses were still in use by the [Royal Navy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Navy) of Britain until 1839 for the timing of [watches](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watchstanding)  
* Backup navigator? Anyone familiar with Sextant and Chronometer? The mercator projection?  
* William: Discuss role of ship's surgeon; have you ever amputated anything?   
* Bolton: Discuss role of first mate; Roll 4 to impress  
* Bolton: Must double as marine leader, equivalent of Lt Colonel; There is no fighting force on the ship, but a few sailors might be handy with a knife.  
  * Ensured the security of the ship's officers  
  * Supported their maintenance of discipline in the ship's crew  
  * In battle command sailors and engage the enemy's crews, whether firing from positions on their own ship, or fighting in boarding actions.  
* Chaplain? Burials at sea?  
* Roles: Who can command boarding actions? Who can command cannon crews?   
* Discuss Marines:  
  * Cochrane is my idol. His resourcefulness is without peer.  
  * The Royal Navy felt that the ranks of Marine field officers were largely honorary.  
  * Red-headed step-children, limited to Lt Col. until 1771, when first col. was made  
  * Major [John Pitcairn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Pitcairn) led marines in the [Battle of Bunker Hill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Bunker_Hill)  
  * During the [War of 1812](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_of_1812) escaped American slaves were formed into [Cochrane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Cochrane)'s second [Corps of Colonial Marines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corps_of_Colonial_Marines), similar to the first corps of freed French slaves on [Marie-Galante](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marie-Galante) were used to form [Sir Alexander Cochrane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Cochrane)'s first [Corps of Colonial Marines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corps_of_Colonial_Marines) helped capture Fort Bowyer in the US

### Visit to the Ship

It is a 17th century caravel complete piece of junk. **Roll 4** to determine that this is, somewhat, a ruse. She is very old, but reasonably seaworthy.

When you board her, there is a lot of creaking and shifting.

Bean is there, on deck, scribbling in a large book with a candle at his side. He greets the captain. 

* Have they met with your satisfaction sir?  
* He speaks of "finding an upgrade."  
* He shows the group copper cladding, stored inside the ship.

Bean invites Harvey to hold forth on his experiences at the Battle of Baltimore, and the shipyards there.

*Our men had just torched the fledgling capitol of the so-called United States when, as we were marching back, we encountered Dr. William Beanes of Upper Marlboro, Maryland. Beanes (no relation to Bean, I'm sure) was a known troublemaker. The rapscallion had jailed two British soldiers as they passed through Upper Marlboro, merely for being merry and perhaps a bit deep in their cups.*

*Well, in retaliation for his bold actions we seized Dr. Beanes and threw him in irons aboard the ship HMS Tonnant. It was then that his friends enlisted the aid of local lawyer and amateur poet, Francis Scott Key, to gain the release of Dr. Beanes. Key approached us and negotiated Dr. Beanes’ release. We sailed up the Chesapeake to the Patapsco River, taking station about eight miles before Fort McHenry. At that time, we released Beanes but insisted that Key remain on the ship until after the imminent battle was over, for his own safety of course.. From his vantage point on our ship, Key observed the 25-hour bombardment of the fort and wrote a little poem.*

*Many know this story, for it was Key who wrote the Star Spangled Banner. But what few knew is that our real intent was hidden. The truth is that we had intelligence of a new form of ship being constructed at Baltimore. A narrow, sleek ship of innovative design.* 

*Bean here lead a small party into that well-defended shipyard. All the while, none suspected that our 25 hour bombardment of the fort was merely cover for this operation. Bean, may I disclose? Those ships were completely new, never before seen, and unutterably fast, called the Batlimore Clippers. Our Top Men are hard at work duplicating the technology, but you know how long ship construction takes, and what with our shortage of timber... Those damnable Americans and their Damnable trees.*

*In any case, in exchange for assistance during the war, the American rebels have granted a number of these Baltimore Clippers to the French. It would be a shame to allow those to remain in French hands. A real shame.*

### Faro

* *Beard says "If it please the assembly we shall play a "Faro Bank". There are hors d'oeuvres for those who wish to watch, and a piano. But for me, I will be playing Faro. Nothing Deep Play you know.*  
* **PCs know**: gambling the family fortune is very common, with high-stakes and high losses--called "deep play". The venue was private clubs, which had an atmosphere that controlled against violence or vehement behavior.  
* Story told of [Charles James Fox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_James_Fox): In three years in his early 20s he ran up £120,000 of losses at the [faro tables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faro_\(card_game\)). Fox was a highly influential politician supported by very rich political allies who regularly covered his losses, but his political enemies rhetorically attacked his heavy losses.  
* *Beard says "I keep a painting of this man in a locket, with me at all times. He is an object lesson to me. Gambling has its place, and must be controlled. Navigation is often a gamble, you know, but with determination the odds can usually be managed. [PIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_James_Fox#/media/File:Charles_James_Fox_by_Karl_Anton_Hickel.jpg)*  
* [Instructions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUARRsVdARs) ([written instructions](https://gathertogethergames.com/faro))  
* [LAYOUT](https://www.riverjunction.com/assets/images/4524/farolayout-1.jpg), [IN PLAY](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/CUARRsVdARs/maxresdefault.jpg), [Cards Shown](https://i.imgur.com/WFDRpRW.png)  
* Play  
  * Players are known to cheat with slight of hand  
  * Beard will eye the cheaters, and it soon becomes clear that this is a test of cheating, not a test of skill.  
  * During play, the Parrot speaks the language Bolton heard in the crypt  
* Cheating includes  
  * Stacked or rigged decks  
  * Rigged dealing boxes  
  * Sleight of Hand when dealing  
  * Move your bet: Roll 4 to succeed  
  * Horsehair silk to move the notes of the bet: Roll 3 to succeed  
  * Removing the copper \- removing the copper via thread when it was a loser

Faro \- roll 1-6 lose 1x, roll 20 win 4x

### Profiles

Captain Henry A.F. Hervey \- Formerly a privateer (pirate) who has seen the work of the corruptor in the Carribean. Possibly an illegitimate son of King George III, he "resembles that Abbot from the Westminster you saved."

Navigator John "Beard" Twomey \- Known for his waist-length bushy beard, people just call him "beard". Grew up on the sea side with a father who was former Navy. He is a harsh critic of anyone not acting "proper" on the ship, despite his non-regulation beard. A skilled gambler.

Beard's Parrot "Tulip" \- a grey parrot with an extensive vocabulary.

Weatherman Zadkiel Tao-Sze aka Richard Morrison \- An inveterate astrologer and the official predictor of the weather, he studies astro-meteorology and write in his Zadkiel's Almanac, which he future-dates as to when the events will happen. [LINK](https://blackcatcaboodle.com/products/1880-1889-zadkiel-10-almanacs-heiroglyphic-future-predictions-astrology), [PIC](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2803/6230/products/57_1495279d-e496-4193-b1fe-e96599079b4b_1024x1024@2x.jpg?v=1571712496), [PIC](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2803/6230/products/57_4e56db55-55df-44df-a933-f1b6835bea53_1024x1024@2x.jpg?v=1571712496), [PIC](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2803/6230/products/57_bd00849b-3a3b-4e33-a5ba-e44ba253efa6_1024x1024@2x.jpg?v=1571712496), [PIC](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2803/6230/products/57_06ad74d5-b1ec-4c25-b266-2d52551d684d_1024x1024@2x.jpg?v=1571712496) [Monkeys](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2803/6230/products/57_37c98ac9-168e-4675-a458-24363466e347_1024x1024@2x.jpg?v=1571712496) . He is constantly trying to predict the future, usually with little success, but he believes it. When it fails, there is always a spurious reason, and when it succeeds he reminds everyone of it for weeks. [Real person](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_James_Morrison).

Terrence Merrywhistle  
Haughty and condescending to anyone not a merchant. An accountant and logistician. Requisitions for gear get a bonus, and the quality of the gear is improved. The team gets 30% more money to spend on the face-value of ship-board equipment. He adds an asset to any trading attempts with locals, including resupply of stores.

# PART 2 \=======

## **The Letter**

*Dear Sir,*

*Mr. Gilroy has informed me of your desire to further discuss matters of import. I shall assist, for I am satisfied that you might profit from such knowledge, and are not apt to use it against the interests of humanity. However, the time is not yet ripe.*

*Speaking of certain matters involves risks of which you might not be aware. Timing, and the setting, and the manner of conveying such information is most delicate. A great man of my acquaintance suffered most grimly for speaking plainly about such matters. We must be cautious. Bad luck, suffering a malign curse, or even the onset of madness might attend should our simple communications be detected, not to mention death.*

*We may meet soon, and discuss limited topics. I can answer a few important questions.*

*The eve before your departure is auspicious: the stars are well aligned that night, the moon's face hidden. I am told a farewell party will be held upon the vessel. Such confusion of minds might provide some cover, and we can retire to a private location, there to discuss.*

*I must ask for your patience in this matter. Though I fear for you to know more, for your sake and the sake of your companions, we must all risk much to serve a greater purpose.*

*At your service,*

*Quintus Antonius*

### Skipped

Constance \- Ship burned in harbor \#15 by enemy, but then stopped by Kensington \#21

- Enemy Percey Moore MIA in Austria, killed his target but failed to return to England; arrogant misogynist prick; competent  
- Friend Sadie Turner disappeared infiltrating Welsh nobleman's estate; Best friend and confidant when young; friendly, beautiful, outgoing; Disappeared working against Welsh nobleman

### Medical Substances

* Experience encounter **Street \#14**, and see \#8  
- Opium, Tin Hookah, Cannabis, Absinthe  
- Lord Jolly on Marshfield Rd.; Percy Cummings from the treasury  
- **Maybe William Invents Morphine**  
- **William learned variolation**  
- Gave William a special salt-rock like drug called Ossicaine

### Quintus Meeting

* On the way to the meeting, experience terrible luck. It becomes apparent it is due to the skull.  
* Experience encounter **Wealthy \#7**. The dog Fidelite escapes, grabs the skull and is killed by a carriage unless a PC can save it.  
* After that, transit through the city is terrible and perilous.

**Skull** \- Regarding the skull, it is utterly evil. He does not know what it portends, but perhaps the scrolls that strange basement man was using contain a clue. If they don't he can collaborate with Henton. If it has a magical essence, it might never be fully destroyed, but it might be purified.  
GM: Ground up skull can be used to enhance magic, but the price is bad luck of varying magnitude, especially if you roll a 1 while using it.

**Scrolls** \- what do they mean. Quintus can read the Hebrew, but he has little insight. He knows that the seventeen sigils Moira attempted to copy are wrong, but not how to rectify it himself. Henton says they look exactly identical. He can not perceive it, but Quintus can. Bolton can too.

**Detecting** \- Roll KT; one can attempt to develop it, but only the gifted succeed. He points out that **you must make a conscious effort** to sense most spirits. It is most often a sense other than sight \- a pressure behind the eyes, a metallic taste... for him the hair raises on the nape of his neck when he holds a haunted object, or sits long in a spirit bound place. He gets a general sense of who they might be, vaguely, and remarks what an advantage it might be to be able to see the spirit clearly. He misunderstands Henton's gift \- Henton sees mists, but additional focus indicates who they are somewhat. 

### Voyage Preview

* Described Factions (see Scenario Ashanti Expedition)

# PART 3 \=======

### Setup

Upon the ship, a celebratory feast comprising the PCs, Captain Harvey, Beard, Zakiel, Merrywhistle, Trotsky, and even Bean and Mr. Mump. Every named person running the ship is present, plus the funders: Lady Shropshire, Fitzherbert, Arkwright, a few others.

**Party Missives**

* Henton: Quintus agrees to meet, as he feels the night of the party (no moon) is the best time for such things.  
* Bolton: Help Capt Harvey glad-hand everyone  
* Constance: Bean asks her to visit the ship before the party and handle security. Gahan is still living there. No specific threat, but the expedition funders will be present. Two of the crew, namely Bully Buster and Josephus Bragg are made available to help. Zadkiel says to expect a light fog, full moon night.  
* William gets a missive from Penny Trotsky to help select books for the voyage.

*A deep fog rolls in as the sun sets. As you approach, you see glowing oil lamps hanging decoratively from the rigging. The sails have been raised, and they too glow with an aetherial light. Flags of many colors hang vertically from the cross timbers. A fiddle plays amidst the hubbub of many voices, laughter and gaiety. The smell of roasted meats, tinted delicately with foreign spices, wafts through the air, mixing with scents of rum and the scented smokes of the hookah. It is as though the ship floats, magical and separate from the cares of London, ready to bring you over a new horizon of opportunity.* [PIC](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/a8/00/44/a8004469d3e151f9f08174d8de7134ec.jpg)

*Striding up to the gang plank you find Captain Harvey, in full dress uniform. He greets you with a hearty handshake, welcoming you jovially.*

*Upon the misty deck you spy a Faro table. Beard sits at one end, accompanied by a pair of young men in boatswain uniforms and a well-dressed man with dark African skin. The African has impeccable, royalist clothing tastes. Nearby, Miss Trotsky the librarian and Richard Morrison the Almanac predictor recline with Maria Fitzherbert, enjoying the pleasures of the hookah. Richard Arkwright holds forth among a group of five including Terence Merrywhistle, each with a glass of bubbling liquor at hand.*

*Upon the deck a vigorous and demanding Italian rules over a blazing barbeque. A full pig roasts there, and succulent skewers of meat roast with vegetables. Three younger boys, between the ages of twelve and fourteen, move about serving drinks. Nearby, a small group enjoys the meal, arguing animatedly.*

*As you board, Captain Harvey emphasizes "Everything must be perfect tonight. Do celebrate, by all means, but keep the investors happy. Their patronage is quite important to us\!"*

*Sitting to one side, a man in frock and black silk top hat, sporting a rich beard and moustache, beckons to Henton.*

*The Captain asks Lt Bolton to accompany him as he sees to the guests, and to be introduced to many of the men he will command when need arises.*

*Up walk two men, dressed for exploration, along with a ship's boy carrying a tray of drinks. You recognize [Bean](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ml4MhMjmapNTFYD-ifeZb_XncwotmAcRF9zSmtC7zb0/edit#bookmark=id.aeqq4jh1kv53). Everyone does. He introduces his companion, a short man suffering from dwarfism, as Mister Mump.*

*Mr. Mump [PIC](https://i.imgur.com/4UbRGNz.jpeg) appears as a Spanish dwarf with narrow eyes and a strange waddling gait. He wears a drooping hat that hides large, deep-set eyes and sports a deep scar across his jaw and left cheek. Mister Mump appears shy of people, and speaks only when he must. You imagine the teasing and bullying he must have endured in his younger years, yet the set of his shoulders and his piercing gaze when he looks at you have an unmistakable confidence.*

*During the greetings, everyone is offered drinks except Constance, who instead gets a glance from Bean as if to say "You know what to do."*

### Stations

* **Faro Table** \- Beard, boatswains Daveys, Osei Kwadwo  
* **Arkwright** \- speaks with cooper Coops Figgleston, carpenter Ruby DuChamps, and the two quartermasters Quentin and Charlie who will serve under Terence.   
* **Passengers** \- The eating group are the other passengers: Diplomats bound for Africa, Jacob Mann, Francis Pell, and others, Tawnsy.  
* **Cooking** \- Greasy and the boys Larry, Hay and Tubby  
* **Harvey** \- Walking about

### Connecting

* **Henton** meets with Quintus; Quintus' man is stationed outside the cabin so they aren't disturbed.  
* **William** finds Penny asking him interesting medical questions.  
* **Lucius \- ?**  
* **Bolton** \- with Capt Harvey, greeting everyone. Tulip the parrot also greets everyone, making comments about their clothes or gender.  
* **Constance, Gahan** \- whatever

### Contact

1. **Henton** gets Skull, Scrolls, and Detecting  
2. **Bolton** to the Captain's cabin, touring Lady Shropshire about; they stop to have a drink, sit and hear a story; Bolton hears strange noises  
3. **William** is invited by Penny to view the inadequate book preparations; they over-indulge; William finds himself smelling tar pitch and then speaking with a spirit.  
4. **Constance, Gahan and Lucius** are free to roam

### Fog Thickens

* [Party Audio](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frEJTGfLOhM); [Fog Horn Audio](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfheZmEDXOc&t=54m50s)  
* **Fog will thicken** unnaturally, so thick one can't see across the deck.  
* **Drinker PCs** are impacted by drugs in the alcohol; **Roll 5m** or lose \-3 perception, and must **roll 3i** or fall asleep.

### Sneaky Attacks

* Agents  
  * **Sneak** into hold; roll vs Sneak  
  * **Agents lure** \- Make luring noises and then garrotte  
  * **Partiers sleep** \- The partiers start to fall asleep, but the **sounds of party continue** all around. Yet, if you come upon a group in the fog, they will be sleeping.  
* **Defenders** \- If a PC gets overwhelmed, either **Bean** or **Lady Fitzherbert** will save the player.  
* **Sound is Weird** \- nobody in cabins hears anything; Shouts wake nobody.  
* **Henton** gets Communicating, Tethering, Research  
* **William** \- can talk to a spirit, but only smells tar pitch and senses it

### Agents

Agents of the Dutch Slavers sneak onto the ship, attempting to assassinate the PCs. The House of Orange, newly ordained rulers of the Netherlands, knows nothing of it. The other PCs must defend those who are learning magic. It will all happen silently, in ways that the partiers will not notice.

**J.S. Grimaldi**  
Grimaldi is at the bow of the ship, disguised as a woman (roll 6), seemingly asleep from drink, under Trance Control. His role is mostly to control the normals, and make a little   
Tier 4, Health 12, armor 0

[JS Grimaldi Details](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ml4MhMjmapNTFYD-ifeZb_XncwotmAcRF9zSmtC7zb0/edit#bookmark=id.zeyszvlll8t3)

* **Morbid Fascination** \- Roll 4s victim becomes fascinated to see a human suffer and die, even if it is their own self. Feels like you are something else, looking through your own eyes. You feel a deep fear of humans. They all need to die. Gahan is already \+2 Specialized against it, while Constance has a \-1 Inability.

A1 \= \-11

**Dutch Agent**  
Tier 3, Health 9, Armor 1

* **Sneak** \- roll 3s, \+1 trained,+1 boisterous party  
* **Thrown knife** \- 2m; Roll 3s, \+1 trained, \+1 from shadows, \+1 if target distracted.  
* **Garrotte lunge** \- Roll 3s, \+1 trained, \+1 from shadows or from behind.  
  * Inflicts 3m per round, ignores armor. Roll 6 to escape. Victim may not shout.  
* **Vanish** \- Roll 5 to detect where he went in the dark fog  
* **Poison Pills** \- All have poison pills in their mouths to suicide if caught.

### Topics

* **Quintus** stations his man outside the cabin where he meets Henton, to run errands. The servant will not make it.  
* **Quintus** makes numerous preparations with "a yellow powder" (sulphur) to distract the spirits.  
* **KT**: Roll 5 suffer immediately after disclosing or learning the material. The rolled result indicates how bad the suffering is. [LINK](https://docs.google.com/document/d/16MG-xMBw-NNMH7-u1lKRB3W0BBsUyh8NoIJqI1vCwdc/edit#bookmark=id.3eyl1eg6vbya)  
* **GM**: The unique characteristic of all players is that they can all climb the ladder of Obscura. That is why they are together.

DONE \* **Communicating** \- Roll KT; To communicate with spirits, he says it is much like communicating with the living. Spirits listen far more than they speak, and you must say or do things they find of interest. Maybe a meal they care about, or the name of a loved one. It is a terrible guessing game with no hints, for the spirit seldom replies. But some are active, for reasons unknown. And if you could only see them

DONE \* **Tethering spirits** \- he has seen a mystic bid a spirit to act, he thinks (it might have been a trick), but he does not know how that was done. He thinks this might be key to opening a wider vista of magic, but doesn't know how.

DONE \* **Research** \- the study of certain books, or meditation upon mysteries, or the careful observation of the natural world, can reveal the mysteries of spirits. He doesn't know why books are always so obscure, and full of seeming gibberish, nor does he know how to tell the true from the false. A mage doing this can discern one characteristic of spirits per game session. Characteristics, Capabilities, Substances or Writing. Currently there are 26 items of knowledge that can be discerned.

# PART 4 \=======

### Situation

* Gahan just lit badguy on fire and shut the door.  
* William has an auscultator tracheotomy  
* Henton has a shoulder injury and kneels beside William  
* Quintus is overwhelmed with guilt  
* Bolton just communicated with Alise; knows the gun was used to kill her; he thinks everything is fine. \[he is never attacked\]  
* Constance is near the magazine aiming to secure it

### Action

* Constance suffers Morbid Fascination; roll five, and counter-fate point can be used (certain entities can do this); she might be reminded of the coin  
* At the magazine door, light flows from beneath.  
* A candle burns in a holder on the floor. A trail of gunpowder leads from a ladder to five barrels, and a wound fuse lies on the floor beside.  
* **Temptation** to light the fuse   
* Upon entry she sees a blood smear with the edge of a single, little footprint no bigger than a child, the smear terminates at the bottom of a ladder leading up two "stories" to the deck.  
* Ascending the ladder, she will see Mr. Mump with a mop and a bucket swabbing the deck.   
* Looking over the side, Bean is rowing a boat with a tarp spread over something the size of about four men.  
* By the time the party emerges, everything is just as it had been. Everyone is awake, drunk, eating or playing; some are in a natural sleep.

### Grimaldi Revealed

* If the agents all fail, Grimaldi will make a final attempt then jump overboard, swimming strongly and holding breath long.

\*\* Spirits can inhabit for a moment, but not a long

### Denouement

* There is a pile of money, untouched, on the Faro table  
* Everyone awakens once Grimaldi is gone, and resume what they were doing, without noticing a thing  
* The bodies are nowhere to be seen, though there is some blood on the deck near the bell, and where Henton climbed the ladder  
* Both Bully and Josephus confess that they fell asleep on watch, and present themselves to be punished; it later transpires that they think Gahan gave them sleepy drink

### Spirits

* \[William\] Tristram \- A man who died building the ship. He was crushed. Restless because his work was never finished. Smells of tar pitch and beer. Speaks english. Talk of high seas adventures will attract him, or the smell of beer or intoxication.  
* \[Henton\] Felix \- Roman slave trapped in the intaglio he knows not how. The slave speaks broken latin. He smells of rosemary, and is pretty servile. Baked fish or hare will attract him.  
* \[Bolton\] Alise \- A french courtesan, who had duped a British consul and was spreading the information he shared in bed, slain by Constance, hovers about her flintlocks. She smells of Rhodium oil and Juniper (french perfumes). She speaks French only.

# Part 5 \=======

## **Maiden Voyage**

Sailing to the Gold Coast is 5,400 miles by sea and takes **two months**. The players might get there faster via Fog Travel.

*Making your way to the docks, the smells of sea salt, fish, cooking and tar compete to win your attention. The harbor on the Thames, known as the Port of London, bustles with ships loading and unloading, sailors on leave staggering out of bars even at this time of days, and the stern shouts of the longshoreman trying not to injure yet another comrade. Crossing to another street, suddenly you are surrounded by Men of Business in tall black hats. The streets are orderly, lined with barrels for shipping. A small island of smartly dressed men chat with a Benedictine brother.*

GM: **Roll 4** to discern that a dark spirit hovers at Mr. Mump's temples

## **Boarding Ship**

Everyone meets at the docks at the appointed time.

* Notice the **sun spots** and hear about the Bologna Prophecy. A military troop marches past, demobilizing from the Napoleonic wars, and blows trumpet. People come out of houses and fall to their knees.  
* An **enormous lens** is loaded onto the ship. The players are told that it is for a lighthouse on the Gold Coast. This is not the case. **Roll 6** to discern that this lens will focus light to a point, not in a line.  
* Meet [Osei Kwadwo](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ml4MhMjmapNTFYD-ifeZb_XncwotmAcRF9zSmtC7zb0/edit#bookmark=id.9jpa3h3rina8)  
  * When he meets the least combat-capable PC, he says "For the animal who does not have a tail, it is God who sweeps his body."  
* Meet Dash and the cats  
* See the paintings in the captain's cabin [PIC](https://static.thebark.com/sites/default/files/styles/full/public/content/article/full/gerard-ter-borch-lady-at-her-toilet-c._1660-800x1018-opt.jpg?itok=fy8sR0xE), [PIC](https://static.thebark.com/sites/default/files/styles/full/public/content/article/insert/hendrick_martensz_sorgh_the_lute_player_1661_800x1076_opt.jpg?itok=38Z3VLqI)

## **Briefing**

* Bean gives everyone a password by which they may know each other.

## **Departure**

*The order is given and aged pulleys squeal as the sails are raised. The old ship creaks and groans forward. The crew is practiced and quick, having trained on every inch of the vessel. The Union Jack is raised, waving bravely in the breeze. Turning slowly to ride the last vestiges of the Thames current, the ship rolls like a fattened pig.*

*Brisk sea breezes and the call of gulls beckon you to the open sea. A bell tolls fadingly from a London tower. Many months, or even years, might pass before you see the smoky town again. Adventure is in the air.*

*You pass one of his majesty's brave warships. The mighty HMS Scepter towers over you, rows of cannon ports hinting at the 74 guns ready to blast enemies of the crown into oblivion.  Leftenant Bolton recognizes this ship: Captor of the French ship Clarisse, the Scepter served in both the East and West Indies. In 1813 captained by [Charles Ross](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Ross_\(Royal_Navy_officer\)), the Sceptre became the flagship of Rear Admiral Sir [George Cockburn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sir_George_Cockburn,_10th_Baronet), who directed the burning of Washington.*

*Soon the only sounds are the breeze, the waves upon your hull, and the scuffle and hurry of well-trained men obeying the orders that will keep you all, afloat and alive, on your coming journey.*
