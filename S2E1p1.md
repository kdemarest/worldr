# Scenario: Bon Voyage

## Part 1
=======

### Captain's Dinner

**Attending:**
* Arthur F. Harvey, Captain PIC
* John "Beard" Twomey, navigator PIC
* Richard "Zadkiel" Morrison, weatherman PIC
* Terrence Merrywhistle, quartermaster PIC
* Harvey's parrot Tulip PIC

### Setting
* Nice house, with a wife and family
* Painting of Alexander Inglis Cochrane in the wall PIC - Capt Harvey's idol

### Events

We are neither military, nor merchant, nor privateer. Yet, we are all of these things. We must adapt and overcome, gentlemen, and you shall better know what I mean when you see our ship. Let us get to know each other, then dine. After, we shall visit the ship briefly, and then retire here for some entertainment.

### Small talk:
* Harvey has seen action in the Navy repelling slave ships with the West Africa Patrol along the Gold Coast, in the war of 1812 at the Battle of Baltimore, and as a King's Privateer in the Caribbean. His experience in the hotter latitudes and his resourcefulness helped him get this position. He was commanded into it by Admiral Cochrane. Was Cochrane right to enlist the freed slaves to fight?
* Beard wants to win the £5,000 for the navigator that could sail within a degree of latitude of the North Pole from the British Commissioners for the discovery of longitude at sea. Who has stories of great seamanship?
* Zadkiel talks of Almanacs, and prediction. He dismisses tarot as hogwash, but thinks there might be some merit in crystal balls. He talks of how his will become great, showing a visionary page. PIC1 PIC2 Do you think prediction is real?
* Merryweather talks about the price of wheat.

### Roles:
* **Current Roles:**
   * Captain overall command
   * Navigator use the sextant and the
   * Weatherman - not a position you've heard of before
   * Quartermaster -
* Harvey presents Beard with a high precision hourglass: Hourglasses were still in use by the Royal Navy of Britain until 1839 for the timing of watches
* Backup navigator? Anyone familiar with Sextant and Chronometer? The mercator projection?
* William: Discuss role of ship's surgeon; have you ever amputated anything?
* Bolton: Discuss role of first mate; Roll 4 to impress
* Bolton: Must double as marine leader, equivalent of Lt Colonel; There is no fighting force on the ship, but a few sailors might be handy with a knife.
   * Ensured the security of the ship's officers
   * Supported their maintenance of discipline in the ship's crew
   * In battle command sailors and engage the enemy's crews, whether firing from positions on their own ship, or fighting in boarding actions.
* Chaplain? Burials at sea?
* Roles: Who can command boarding actions? Who can command cannon crews?

### Discuss Marines:
* Cochrane is my idol. His resourcefulness is without peer.
* The Royal Navy felt that the ranks of Marine field officers were largely honorary.
* Red-headed step-children, limited to Lt Col. until 1771, when first col. was made
* Major John Pitcairn led marines in the Battle of Bunker Hill
* During the War of 1812 escaped American slaves were formed into Cochrane's second Corps of Colonial Marines, similar to the first corps of freed French slaves on Marie-Galante were used to form Sir Alexander Cochrane's first Corps of Colonial Marines helped capture Fort Bowyer in the US

### Visit to the Ship

It is a 17th century caravel complete piece of junk. Roll 4 to determine that this is, somewhat, a ruse. She is very old, but reasonably seaworthy.

When you board her, there is a lot of creaking and shifting.

Bean is there, on deck, scribbling in a large book with a candle at his side. He greets the captain.
* Have they met with your satisfaction sir?
* He speaks of "finding an upgrade."
* He shows the group copper cladding, stored inside the ship.

Bean invites Harvey to hold forth on his experiences at the Battle of Baltimore, and the shipyards there.

Our men had just torched the fledgling capitol of the so-called United States when, as we were marching back, we encountered Dr. William Beanes of Upper Marlboro, Maryland. Beanes (no relation to Bean, I'm sure) was a known troublemaker. The rapscallion had jailed two British soldiers as they passed through Upper Marlboro, merely for being merry and perhaps a bit deep in their cups.

Well, in retaliation for his bold actions we seized Dr. Beanes and threw him in irons aboard the ship HMS Tonnant. It was then that his friends enlisted the aid of local lawyer and amateur poet, Francis Scott Key, to gain the release of Dr. Beanes. Key approached us and negotiated Dr. Beanes’ release. We sailed up the Chesapeake to the Patapsco River, taking station about eight miles before Fort McHenry. At that time, we released Beanes but insisted that Key remain on the ship until after the imminent battle was over, for his own safety of course. From his vantage point on our ship, Key observed the 25-hour bombardment of the fort and wrote a little poem.

Many know this story, for it was Key who wrote the Star Spangled Banner. But what few knew is that our real intent was hidden. The truth is that we had intelligence of a new form of ship being constructed at Baltimore. A narrow, sleek ship of innovative design.

Bean here led a small party into that well-defended shipyard. All the while, none suspected that our 25 hour bombardment of the fort was merely cover for this operation. Bean, may I disclose? Those ships were completely new, never before seen, and unutterably fast, called the Baltimore Clippers. Our Top Men are hard at work duplicating the technology, but you know how long ship construction takes, and what with our shortage of timber... Those damnable Americans and their Damnable trees.

In any case, in exchange for assistance during the war, the American rebels have granted a number of these Baltimore Clippers to the French. It would be a shame to allow those to remain in French hands. A real shame.

### Faro

* Beard says "If it please the assembly we shall play a 'Faro Bank'. There are hors d'oeuvres for those who wish to watch, and a piano. But for me, I will be playing Faro. Nothing Deep Play you know."
* PCs know: gambling the family fortune is very common, with high-stakes and high losses--called "deep play". The venue was private clubs, which had an atmosphere that controlled against violence or vehement behavior.
* Story told of Charles James Fox: In three years in his early 20s he ran up £120,000 of losses at the faro tables. Fox was a highly influential politician supported by very rich political allies who regularly covered his losses, but his political enemies rhetorically attacked his heavy losses.
* Beard says "I keep a painting of this man in a locket, with me at all times. He is an object lesson to me. Gambling has its place, and must be controlled. Navigation is often a gamble, you know, but with determination the odds can usually be managed." PIC
* Instructions (written instructions)
* LAYOUT, IN PLAY, Cards Shown
* Play
   * Players are known to cheat with sleight of hand
   * Beard will eye the cheaters, and it soon becomes clear that this is a test of cheating, not a test of skill.
   * During play, the Parrot speaks the language Bolton heard in the crypt
* Cheating includes
   * Stacked or rigged decks
   * Rigged dealing boxes
   * Sleight of Hand when dealing
   * Move your bet: Roll 4 to succeed
   * Horsehair silk to move the notes of the bet: Roll 3 to succeed
   * Removing the copper - removing the copper via thread when it was a loser

Faro - roll 1-6 lose 1x, roll 20 win 4x

### Profiles

Captain Henry A.F. Hervey - Formerly a privateer (pirate) who has seen the work of the corruptor in the Caribbean. Possibly an illegitimate son of King George III, he "resembles that Abbot from the Westminster you saved."

Navigator John "Beard" Twomey - Known for his waist-length bushy beard, people just call him "beard". Grew up on the seaside with a father who was former Navy. He is a harsh critic of anyone not acting "proper" on the ship, despite his non-regulation beard. A skilled gambler.

Beard's Parrot "Tulip" - a grey parrot with an extensive vocabulary.

Weatherman Zadkiel Tao-Sze aka Richard Morrison - An inveterate astrologer and the official predictor of the weather, he studies astro-meteorology and writes in his Zadkiel's Almanac, which he future-dates as to when the events will happen. LINK, PIC, PIC, PIC, PIC Monkeys. He is constantly trying to predict the future, usually with little success, but he believes it. When it fails, there is always a spurious reason, and when it succeeds he reminds everyone of it for weeks. Real person.

Terrence Merrywhistle  
Haughty and condescending to anyone not a merchant. An accountant and logistician. Requisitions for gear get a bonus, and the quality of the gear is improved. The team gets 30% more money to spend on the face-value of ship-board equipment. He adds an asset to any trading attempts with locals, including resupply of stores.

## PART 2

### The Letter

Dear Sir,

Mr. Gilroy has informed me of your desire to further discuss matters of import. I shall assist, for I am satisfied that you might profit from such knowledge, and are not apt to use it against the interests of humanity. However, the time is not yet ripe.

Speaking of certain matters involves risks of which you might not be aware. Timing, and the setting, and the manner of conveying such information is most delicate. A great man of my acquaintance suffered most grimly for speaking plainly about such matters. We must be cautious. Bad luck, suffering a malign curse, or even the onset of madness might attend should our simple communications be detected, not to mention death.

We may meet soon, and discuss limited topics. I can answer a few important questions.

The eve before your departure is auspicious: the stars are well aligned that night, the moon's face hidden. I am told a farewell party will be held upon the vessel. Such confusion of minds might provide some cover, and we can retire to a private location, there to discuss.

I must ask for your patience in this matter. Though I fear for you to know more, for your sake and the sake of your companions, we must all risk much to serve a greater purpose.

At your service,

Quintus Antonius

### Skipped

Constance - Ship burned in harbor #15 by enemy, but then stopped by Kensington #21
* Enemy Percey Moore MIA in Austria, killed his target but failed to return to England; arrogant misogynist prick; competent
* Friend Sadie Turner disappeared infiltrating Welsh nobleman's estate; Best friend and confidant when young; friendly, beautiful, outgoing; Disappeared working against Welsh nobleman

### Medical Substances
* Experience encounter Street #14, and see #8
* Opium, Tin Hookah, Cannabis, Absinthe
* Lord Jolly on Marshfield Rd.; Percy Cummings from the treasury
* Maybe William Invents Morphine
* William learned variolation
* Gave William a special salt-rock like drug called Ossicaine

### Quintus Meeting
* On the way to the meeting, experience terrible luck. It becomes apparent it is due to the skull.
* Experience encounter Wealthy #7. The dog Fidelite escapes, grabs the skull and is killed by a carriage unless a PC can save it.
* After that, transit through the city is terrible and perilous.

### Skull

Regarding the skull, it is utterly evil. He does not know what it portends, but perhaps the scrolls that strange basement man was using contain a clue. If they don't he can collaborate with Henton. If it has a magical essence, it might never be fully destroyed, but it might be purified.

**GM:** Ground up skull can be used to enhance magic, but the price is bad luck of varying magnitude, especially if you roll a 1 while using it.

### Scrolls

What do they mean. Quintus can read the Hebrew, but he has little insight. He knows that the seventeen sigils Moira attempted to copy are wrong, but not how to rectify it himself. Henton says they look exactly identical. He cannot perceive it, but Quintus can. Bolton can too.

### Detecting

Roll KT; one can attempt to develop it, but only the gifted succeed. He points out that you must make a conscious effort to sense most spirits. It is most often a sense other than sight - a pressure behind the eyes, a metallic taste... for him the hair raises on the nape of his neck when he holds a haunted object, or sits long in a spirit bound place. He gets a general sense of who they might be, vaguely, and remarks what an advantage it might be to be able to see the spirit clearly. He misunderstands Henton's gift - Henton sees mists, but additional focus indicates who they are somewhat.
