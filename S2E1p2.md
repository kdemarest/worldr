## PART 2

### The Letter

Dear Sir,

Mr. Gilroy has informed me of your desire to further discuss matters of import. I shall assist, for I am satisfied that you might profit from such knowledge, and are not apt to use it against the interests of humanity. However, the time is not yet ripe.

Speaking of certain matters involves risks of which you might not be aware. Timing, and the setting, and the manner of conveying such information is most delicate. A great man of my acquaintance suffered most grimly for speaking plainly about such matters. We must be cautious. Bad luck, suffering a malign curse, or even the onset of madness might attend should our simple communications be detected, not to mention death.

We may meet soon, and discuss limited topics. I can answer a few important questions.

The eve before your departure is auspicious: the stars are well aligned that night, the moon's face hidden. I am told a farewell party will be held upon the vessel. Such confusion of minds might provide some cover, and we can retire to a private location, there to discuss.

I must ask for your patience in this matter. Though I fear for you to know more, for your sake and the sake of your companions, we must all risk much to serve a greater purpose.

At your service,

Quintus Antonius

### Quintus Meeting
* On the way to the meeting, experience terrible luck. It becomes apparent it is due to the skull.
* Experience encounter Wealthy #7. The dog Fidelite escapes, grabs the skull and is killed by a carriage unless a PC can save it.
* After that, transit through the city is terrible and perilous.

### Skull

Regarding the skull, it is utterly evil. He does not know what it portends, but perhaps the scrolls that strange basement man was using contain a clue. If they don't he can collaborate with Henton. If it has a magical essence, it might never be fully destroyed, but it might be purified.

**GM:** Ground up skull can be used to enhance magic, but the price is bad luck of varying magnitude, especially if you roll a 1 while using it.

### Scrolls

What do they mean. Quintus can read the Hebrew, but he has little insight. He knows that the seventeen sigils Moira attempted to copy are wrong, but not how to rectify it himself. Henton says they look exactly identical. He cannot perceive it, but Quintus can. Bolton can too.

### Detecting

Roll KT; one can attempt to develop it, but only the gifted succeed. He points out that you must make a conscious effort to sense most spirits. It is most often a sense other than sight - a pressure behind the eyes, a metallic taste... for him the hair raises on the nape of his neck when he holds a haunted object, or sits long in a spirit bound place. He gets a general sense of who they might be, vaguely, and remarks what an advantage it might be to be able to see the spirit clearly. He misunderstands Henton's gift - Henton sees mists, but additional focus indicates who they are somewhat.
