## PART 3
=======

### Setup

Upon the ship, a celebratory feast comprising the PCs, Captain Harvey, Beard, Zakiel, Merrywhistle, Trotsky, and even Bean and Mr. Mump. Every named person running the ship is present, plus the funders: Lady Shropshire, Fitzherbert, Arkwright, a few others.

### Party Missives
* Henton: Quintus agrees to meet, as he feels the night of the party (no moon) is the best time for such things.
* Bolton: Help Capt Harvey glad-hand everyone
* Constance: Bean asks her to visit the ship before the party and handle security. Gahan is still living there. No specific threat, but the expedition funders will be present. Two of the crew, namely Bully Buster and Josephus Bragg are made available to help. Zadkiel says to expect a light fog, full moon night.
* William gets a missive from Penny Trotsky to help select books for the voyage.

A deep fog rolls in as the sun sets. As you approach, you see glowing oil lamps hanging decoratively from the rigging. The sails have been raised, and they too glow with an aetherial light. Flags of many colors hang vertically from the cross timbers. A fiddle plays amidst the hubbub of many voices, laughter and gaiety. The smell of roasted meats, tinted delicately with foreign spices, wafts through the air, mixing with scents of rum and the scented smokes of the hookah. It is as though the ship floats, magical and separate from the cares of London, ready to bring you over a new horizon of opportunity. PIC

Striding up to the gang plank you find Captain Harvey, in full dress uniform. He greets you with a hearty handshake, welcoming you jovially.

Upon the misty deck you spy a Faro table. Beard sits at one end, accompanied by a pair of young men in boatswain uniforms and a well-dressed man with dark African skin. The African has impeccable, royalist clothing tastes. Nearby, Miss Trotsky the librarian and Richard Morrison the Almanac predictor recline with Maria Fitzherbert, enjoying the pleasures of the hookah. Richard Arkwright holds forth among a group of five including Terence Merrywhistle, each with a glass of bubbling liquor at hand.

Upon the deck a vigorous and demanding Italian rules over a blazing barbeque. A full pig roasts there, and succulent skewers of meat roast with vegetables. Three younger boys, between the ages of twelve and fourteen, move about serving drinks. Nearby, a small group enjoys the meal, arguing animatedly.

As you board, Captain Harvey emphasizes "Everything must be perfect tonight. Do celebrate, by all means, but keep the investors happy. Their patronage is quite important to us!"

Sitting to one side, a man in frock and black silk top hat, sporting a rich beard and moustache, beckons to Henton.

The Captain asks Lt Bolton to accompany him as he sees to the guests, and to be introduced to many of the men he will command when need arises.

Up walk two men, dressed for exploration, along with a ship's boy carrying a tray of drinks. You recognize Bean. Everyone does. He introduces his companion, a short man suffering from dwarfism, as Mister Mump.

Mr. Mump PIC appears as a Spanish dwarf with narrow eyes and a strange waddling gait. He wears a drooping hat that hides large, deep-set eyes and sports a deep scar across his jaw and left cheek. Mister Mump appears shy of people, and speaks only when he must. You imagine the teasing and bullying he must have endured in his younger years, yet the set of his shoulders and his piercing gaze when he looks at you have an unmistakable confidence.

During the greetings, everyone is offered drinks except Constance, who instead gets a glance from Bean as if to say "You know what to do."

2. Bolton to the Captain's cabin, touring Lady Shropshire about; they stop to have a drink, sit and hear a story; Bolton hears strange noises

4. Constance, Gahan and Lucius are free to roam

### Fog Thickens
* Party Audio; Fog Horn Audio
* Fog will thicken unnaturally, so thick one can't see across the deck.

### Sneaky Attacks
* Agents
   * Sneak into hold; roll vs Sneak
   * Agents lure - Make luring noises and then garrotte
   * Partiers sleep - The partiers start to fall asleep, but the sounds of party continue all around. Yet, if you come upon a group in the fog, they will be sleeping.
* Defenders - If a PC gets overwhelmed, either Bean or Lady Fitzherbert will save the player.
* Sound is Weird - nobody in cabins hears anything; Shouts wake nobody.
* Henton gets Communicating, Tethering, Research
* William - can talk to a spirit, but only smells tar pitch and senses it

### Agents

Agents of the Dutch Slavers sneak onto the ship, attempting to assassinate the PCs. The House of Orange, newly ordained rulers of the Netherlands, knows nothing of it. The other PCs must defend those who are learning magic. It will all happen silently, in ways that the partiers will not notice.

### J.S. Grimaldi

Grimaldi is at the bow of the ship, disguised as a woman (roll 6), seemingly asleep from drink, under Trance Control. His role is mostly to control the normals, and make a little

Tier 4, Health 12, armor 0

#### Trance Control Powers

### JS Grimaldi Details
* Morbid Fascination - Roll 4s victim becomes fascinated to see a human suffer and die, even if it is their own self. Feels like you are something else, looking through your own eyes. You feel a deep fear of humans. They all need to die. Gahan is already +2 Specialized against it, while Constance has a -1 Inability.

A1 = -11

### Dutch Agent

Tier 3, Health 9, Armor 1
* Sneak - roll 3s, +1 trained, +1 boisterous party

* Garrotte lunge - Roll 3s, +1 trained, +1 from shadows or from behind.
   * Inflicts 3m per round, ignores armor. Roll 6 to escape. Victim may not shout.
* Vanish - Roll 5 to detect where he went in the dark fog
* Poison Pills - All have poison pills in their mouths to suicide if caught.

### Topics
* Quintus stations his man outside the cabin where he meets Henton, to run errands. The servant will not make it.
* Quintus makes numerous preparations with "a yellow powder" (sulphur) to distract the spirits.
* KT: Roll 5 suffer immediately after disclosing or learning the material. The rolled result indicates how bad the suffering is. LINK
* GM: The unique characteristic of all players is that they can all climb the ladder of Obscura. That is why they are together.

DONE * Communicating - Roll KT; To communicate with spirits, he says it is much like communicating with the living. Spirits listen far more than they speak, and you must say or do things they find of interest. Maybe a meal they care about, or the name of a loved one. It is a terrible guessing game with no hints, for the spirit seldom replies. But some are active, for reasons unknown. And if you could only see them

DONE * Tethering spirits - he has seen a mystic bid a spirit to act, he thinks (it might have been a trick), but he does not know how that was done. He thinks this might be key to opening a wider vista of magic, but doesn't know how.

DONE * Research - the study of certain books, or meditation upon mysteries, or the careful observation of the natural world, can reveal the mysteries of spirits. He doesn't know why books are always so obscure, and full of seeming gibberish, nor does he know how to tell the true from the false. A mage doing this can discern one characteristic of spirits per game session. Characteristics, Capabilities, Substances or Writing. Currently there are 26 items of knowledge that can be discerned.
