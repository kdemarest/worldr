### Setting

*As your ship approaches Le Havre [MAP](http://unesco.lehavre.fr/sites/default/files/styles/fo_popin_desktop/public/thumbnails/image/0106371nulb001.jpg?itok=2KuE8kTU), the citadel and great fortress walls loom ahead and to your starboard. On the beach a ship called the Marengo is careened [LINK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Careening) for replacement of the wood sheathing. To port stands the harbor entrance, surrounded by warehouses, quais, and buildings of commerce. Farther inland, the critical Vauban canal leads to the Seine and onward to Paris. Tall masts rise over the town, hinting at the basins of La Barre, Commerce, and the King.*

*You hold station briefly outside the harbor, waiting your turn to enter as the tide slowly rolls in. The portmaster's launch will soon hail you, seeking to board and collect taxes due on incoming cargo.*

*On the shore you can see the defensive citadel to the south, and the tower guarding the entrance to the harbor straight ahead. [PIC](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DfQVlTFX4AAMBMW.jpg)* 

*After waiting for the tide to come in, you are towed past the round entry tower [PIC](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/be/Henry_Smartly_-_Ship_Queen_Victoria_-_a_Close_Call_Entering_Le_Havre.jpg) into Avant Harbor.*

Threads

- Get clad (letter of credit)  
- Steal from library  
- Save the baby's life  
- Disable the chain

### Missions

* DONE Gather Intelligence as above  
* Probably convince Soult to buy the cladding, and pay to have it mounted, using a false letter of credit  
* Negotiate with Soult; he is very shrewd \- roll 6  
* Deliver the cladding, taking payment in whatever form  
* The French lead by Francois and instructed by Frank will mount the cladding. [PIC](https://ussconstitutionmuseum.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/282-2a_001-copy-1024x695.jpg)  
* While it is mounted (two weeks), prepare the heist  
* Plenty of time to get [tattoos](https://thestyleup.com/sailor-jerry-tattoo-ideas/)  
* The team will finish Marengo first; it is a fast ship, and new wood cladding will make it quick. It is also ready to sail, with a full crew aboard.

### Heist

* **DONE DANGER:** The ship will be righted that afternoon. Oh no\!  
* **DANGER**: Swivel bridge codes changed last minute  
* **DANGER**: Talleyrand will appear, seeking a tour of the ship, on the night of the heist.  
* Barring player intervention, Soult will lose his daughter, but not his wife, the night before the righting  
* Zadkiel predicts clear, half-moon weather the night of Regle's completion  
* Somehow get the ship, sail it out, and deal with:  
  * The response time from the citadel  
  * The bridge(s) being closed  
  * The underwater chain  
  * The Marengo's speed; it will follow after, hired by Soult or Talleyrand, but if you sail upwind they are lost

## **Departure**

*The crew scurries across the ship, trying to guess which ropes to pull, and squinting at the workings of the gaffs, jib and stay sail.* 

* You will pass Fort Clonque, a British fort on an island extremely close to France. It is an extreme demonstration of Britain's naval power, as it is considered a Channel Island. [PIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landmark_Trust#/media/File:Alderney_-_Fort_Clonque_02.jpg)

### Thomas Rowlandson

[PIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Rowlandson)

### Jean-De-Dieu Soult, Exile (called Rene in public)

[PIC](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ee/Jean-de-Dieu_Soult%2C_mar%C3%A9chal_duc_de_Dalmatie_%281769-1851%29.jpg/800px-Jean-de-Dieu_Soult%2C_mar%C3%A9chal_duc_de_Dalmatie_%281769-1851%29.jpg)

* Motivation: Deliver a Baltimore clipper to regain favor with Louis XVIII  
* Weakness: **over-delegation**  
* Mistake: Initially supported the Bourbon restoration but *immediately* jumped back to Napoleon. Now in exile in Germany. Except he isn't.  
* Sensitivity: Failed at the [Battle of Coruña](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Coru%C3%B1a) to capture Moore's 35,000 British soldiers, who escaped in royal navy ships.   
* He was Chief of Staff at Waterloo. Command there was *not* working together well.  
* He will be recalled to France in 1819 and become Minister of War and 10th Prime Minister of France

## **Land's End**

Just off Land's End at the very western tip of England [PIC](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/af/Land%27s_End%2C_Cornwall%2C_England.jpg/1024px-Land%27s_End%2C_Cornwall%2C_England.jpg), weigh anchor near Dr. Syntax's Head [LINK](http://www.esmerel.com/circle/britain/syntax.html) named after the famed children's book character Dr. Syntax [PIC](http://www.esmerel.com/images/syntax.jpg).

After waiting the day and into the evening, at full dark of night...

The PCs must row a longboat to a rocky beach [PIC](http://www.laddfamily.com/Files/Stephen%20Hopkins/Pictures/longboat.jpg), there to meet a soldier with a woman six months pregnant, named [Augusta Sims](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ml4MhMjmapNTFYD-ifeZb_XncwotmAcRF9zSmtC7zb0/edit#bookmark=id.qpw8m7cju3pw), accompanied by her uncle, a man named John Sims. [PIC](https://i.imgur.com/A73Vota.jpg), [PIC](https://i.imgur.com/Wn7mQdO.jpeg). Return with them to the ship, where she will give birth in November.

She weeps every night for a week after she arrives (missing Leopold and knowing he must be made to think her dead) but then recovers and walks spiritedly about the decks. She is candid, undignified, fondly speaks of horses and knows Beethoven's 5th. But she never mingles with the sailors, ever. She is smart enough to seek the advice of the knowledgeable.
