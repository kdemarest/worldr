IDEAS

* Ashanti "soul washer" and soul washer's badge  
* An African mask of some sort of strange creature and you must put it on in order to solve a puzzle that gets you through a door. When the door opens it wraps tentacles about your head melds into your skin and you end up looking like the mask permanently possibly like the creature and possibly as if you are just wearing a straw mask forever  
* The strangeness of the PCs should put people off. Rejection by local cultures  
* The BTs are breached, after the PCs learn of them. All seems lost.  
* Black cat... Listening? Watching?  
* Benedictines who sacrifice themselves for the party  
* The importance of bloodlines, but not in the way one might think. Obscura  
* How can each character find greatness? Find destiny?  
* Female warrior should have a moment of extreme bravery.  
* Huge contrast: city and ship to black night in the jungle. Disaster. Starving in the jungle.  
* William feels the deep synergy with untamed nature, like he has never experienced before.  
* Constance feels the purity of survival, not in a human city, but against nature.  
* See 

## **Events**

* Bolton sees a storm on the sea like the one on his vision. It is a test of everyone's character.  
* Gahan: a rude sailor decides he doesn't like him "putting on airs" as a passenger. "You're not better'n me". Eventually frames him for theft.  
* Constance sees evidence of betrayal by Gahan, but it is faked or coincidental.

## **Trial by Fire**

* The crew must learn how to sail this ship, but it bonds them together.

## **Messages**

*There is a commotion on deck, and you realize that the crew is pointing up at a very large bird with a wingspan wider than the height of a man.*

GM: Regular white albatrosses visit bearing messages for [Bean](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ml4MhMjmapNTFYD-ifeZb_XncwotmAcRF9zSmtC7zb0/edit#bookmark=id.aeqq4jh1kv53). The bird always waits on a spar, and the crew loves to feed it, meaning that somebody has always touched it before Bean sees it. Bean usually goes below to unseal the wax-sealed capsule, and returns with a new one, affixes it to the bird's leg, and off it flies.

One day it is a Black Albatross. The sailor who found it gradually goes mad, and exhibits Paranoid Schizophrenia, thinking that everyone trying to kill him holds two fingers together to signal their threatening intent. He then becomes Overthrown.

He suddenly goes over the edge one day, and either stabs or pushes overboard a PC at an opportune time. Have to pick which one \- somebody who knows too much. It is sudden, without warning. The PC must be nursed back to health.

Searching his personal chest, one finds:

* *The Lustful Turk* (1764)  
* *An Experimental Lecture by Colonel Spanker* (1778)  
* *Revelries\! and Devilries\!\!* (1767)  
* *The Adventurous Nun Begs Forgiveness*

Those books, if not stowed carefully, later vanish mysteriously. (of course the crew have nipped them).

# **Part 1 \===========**

## **West Africa Squadron**

Sir [George Collier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sir_George_Collier,_1st_Baronet), leader of the West Africa Squadron, and Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath. 

## **The Chase**

1. On the way to the Gold Coast, see the British ship **HMS Owen Glendower**, a ship of the West Africa Squadron.  
2. A caravel, the Spanish slaver the **Santa Maria de la Luz**, appears from a fog. There are many slaves aboard [PIC](http://coreybarksdale.com/african-american-history/images/african-american-pictures/slave-ship-bristol.jpg)  
3. Captain **Francisco de Rosa** has already ordered its human cargo overboard in an attempt to avoid prosecution when the Glendower is sighted.  
4. The slaver tacks towards the PC ship, which may (with skill) turn into its path, causing it to lose headwind and be captured.  
5. PC ship picks up as many as it can. Opportunities for doctoring, deciphering what the natives say they need (a warning that one is mad, and another is pregnant), and capturing one who was actually a mulato sailor and tries to fight free.  
6. They tow the ship to shore, releasing the slaves there.

# **Part 3 \=======**

GM:

* **Jerry Smith**, a British sailor wants to leave the Glendower, too scarred by what he has seen. He can't continue cleaning the slave ships after capture.  
* **Ali Eisami** [PIC](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/c/c7/Ali_eisami.jpg) [LINK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ali_Eisami), a released slave, begs to join the party. He is discussed [here](https://www.quora.com/What-efforts-did-the-British-make-in-stopping-the-Trans-Atlantic-slave-trade-after-it-was-outlawed-and-what-was-the-cost-How-effective-where-the-efforts-and-how-many-slaves-were-freed-What-happened-to-the-freed). He later takes the name William Harding, after a man who died to rescue him.

## **Mixed Court**

Freetown (first called Grandville Town) in Sierra Leone was started in 1787 by 400 formerly enslaved black people from London. An organization set up by Jonah Hanway and the British abolitionist, Granville Sharp arranged it.

In 1792, 1,100 former American slaves chose to go to Sierra Leone from Nova Scotia. They sailed in 15 ships. **Thomas Peters**, an ex slave, led them. He had fled the Province of North Carolina with the British during the American Revolutionary War, having served as a Black Loyalist. In 1808 the squadron was based there. That is where most of the freed slaves were released.

Making port at Freetown in Sierra Leone, you drop of members of the Mixed Court.

* Freetown is so-called because it was started by freed slaves with the support of a British abolitionist. It is where nearly all slaves released from slave ships are released. [PIC](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-e47312dcc958921ee9de91733afbce5b)  
* Freetown is the headquarters of the West Africa Squadron  
* They mention how **Charles MacCarthy**, the governor, was at the [battle of Nsamankow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Nsamankow) but he hasn't been heard of since. MacCarthy did so much for the freed slaves \- starting colonies, getting them educations. He was very anti-slavery, and in fact was scheduled to be knighted.

In 1817, several [Mixed Commission Courts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixed_Commission_Court) were established, replacing the Vice Admiralty Court in Freetown. These Mixed Commission Courts had officials from both Britain and foreign powers, with Anglo-Portuguese, Anglo-Spanish, and Anglo-Dutch courts being established in Sierra Leone.

Anglo-Portuguese, Anglo-Spanish and Anglo-Dutch courts in [Freetown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freetown), [Sierra Leone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierra_Leone).

GM:

* Emphasize the strange conditions: squalid living, spontaneous eruptions of governance, a mixture of hope and difficulty

# **Part 4 \=======**

Missive

- At Freetown you are given a message for Charles MacCarthy, informing him of his recall to England to be knighted.
