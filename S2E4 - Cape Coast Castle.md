# PART 6 \=======

## **Free Day**

*Your group enters the nearby Fante village. The native Fante, men and women, are bare chested, wearing colorful loin clothes.*

*The exception is a group of native men in white, with strips of white cloth tied around their calves contrasting sharply with their dark skin. They stand about holding cricket bats as their two batters contest against a motley assortment of sailors from the various ships moored off the coast.*

*Children run happily in the streets, shouting and climbing trees, or using sticks to shoot at each other as if with muskets. A small group tosses an Indian rubber ball, kicking it from one player to the next.*

*It is market day. In a broad clearing worn bare from the passage of many feet, vendors sit on low stools. Their goods are in baskets which they themselves have carried since before dawn. Brightly colored fabrics, palm oil lamps, natural and carved ivory and mahogany, gold dust, crafted metal objects and jewelry, and more are available. Some vendors sit under mango trees with tools, ready to repair common objects or sharpen knives.*

- **Cricket** is being played by local Fante men against an assortment of sailors from various boats. The Fante wear white loin clothes in honor of the regular cricket outfits. They are loud and boisterous, and their method of clapping is to hoot with hands to their mouths.  
- **Market Day**, many things are for sale. The Fante Market has  
  - Gold \- dust, nuggets or ingots  
  - Mahogany \- boards, planed and squared by hand  
  - Feathers \- figbird, wagtail, currawong, silvereye, sulphur cockatoo  
  - Ivory \- elephant, rhino, hog; ivory figurine of an elephant  
  - Aggry beads [PIC](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0429/9477/products/image_965d3dda-e061-4e50-9008-e281d9e72fba_3016x.jpg?v=1571265761)  
  - Rubber  
  - Palm oil  
  - Kente fabric \- bright and multi-colored; [color symbolism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kente_cloth#Symbolic_meanings_of_the_colors); modeled by a local woman   
  - Carvings, small. Said to be wards against attack: hyena, leopard, forest hog, kikiyaon, emela-ntouka, werebaboon  
  - Carvings, large. Typically wood, these are most often men. The local word for these is "Goga-lim"  
- **Salt caravan** arrives. People shout "Azalai" in the market and dancing ensues. A trans Saharan salt caravan arrives  
- **Drinkers** \- A PC is invited. They all spill a little on the ground before drinking to please the spirits. To fail to do this is an insult to the ancestors. Upon rising from your stool you MUST instantly (or have your servant instantly) lay it upon its side to prevent a bad spirit from occupying your place.  
- **Jack the Baboon** [LINK](https://imgur.com/gallery/GxUBvvw) \- Jack works the castle gate that lets people in and out  
- **Caboceers** \- An Ashanti appointed by the King to find, acquire, and deliver slaves to the white traders.  
- **Ekua** the [soothsayer](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ml4MhMjmapNTFYD-ifeZb_XncwotmAcRF9zSmtC7zb0/edit#bookmark=id.bylkpl25wpdv) is available. She will kill a chicken (thinking it to being a conduit to the spirits), look at the guts, and smear blood on different parts of your body depending on what she reads. Then she will give you a prediction.  
  *Ekua, with many brightly colored head scarves and numerous wrist bangles, holds the hand of a native man. She chops the head off a chicken and spreads its entrails upon a flat piece of stone. Then, dipping her finger in the blood, she smears it on your forehead and wrists.*  
  - 50% \- free Player Intrusion in one of these situations: ants, poku's demise, kikiyaon, meeting Afia, hazards, heat  
  - 50% \- free GM intrusion in a situation named above  
- Observe **apparatus** for slave trading, but it goes unused  
- **A Proud Woman** \- Someone sees a proud woman with a retinue. A suspicious character is following her. They can investigate, and will see Afia get a prophecy \- she will face the Ashanti 99 times; she will shelter many from their fury; her two sons will rule; the player can understand it because there is a translator into English since Afia (who also speaks English) and the Wise Woman do not speak any shared language

## **Evening Dinner**

- Formal dress is required, which at the castle means "a clean shirt" at minimum, but as fine as you can muster. There is clothing for loan, because many face the problem.  
- Terrence comes to each room: **Players**: How do you style your announcement?  
- Guests are announced as they enter the parlor  
- Attending:  
  - **John Smith**  
  - **Fannie Smith**, wearing a corset, a bodice, stockings, a petticoat, a gown, ruffles and shoes  
  - **Mr. Walcot**, a dane with no stated business, but who talks of missing the continent incessantly. (he is overthrown)  
  - **Sofia Walcot** \- daughter of Walcot  
  - **Compte de Verlet** \- a "reformed Bonapartist" doing survey for the Kumasi road  
  - **Nuño Tristao** \- Portuguese captain of the Boa Esperança, a not-quite-converted slaving ship. His hair is greasy, his smile false, and his eyes are dead. He is very friendly. He looks at you like he both wants something from you, and fears you might speak  
  - **Harold Quincy Harbinger** \- British captain of the exploration vessel Duke of Cornwall. He tells of strange events at Easter Island (see the Easter island adventure) \- feelings of being watched; the statues looming over you. When sailing away, a strange feeling of being called back.  
  - **The Negotiation Expedition**  
    - **Mr. James** \- an incompetent, but the head of the expedition  
    - **Thomas"Ed" Bowdich** \- [LINK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Edward_Bowdich) [PIC](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5e/Thomas_Edward_Bowdich.jpg/220px-Thomas_Edward_Bowdich.jpg) Here to negotiate with the Ashante king. Will later write the first history of the Ashante. Here is his [book](https://archive.org/details/missionfromcapec00bowd)  
    - W Howley  
    - Henry Tedlie  
- Dinner bell and everyone retires into the dining chamber: [18C dining](http://umich.edu/~ece/student_projects/food/rules.htm)  
  - Etiquette is extensive, most notably, you send a manservant to fetch dishes, nobody "passes the peas"  
- Course1:  
  - The host serves duckling soup  
  - Servants bring kabobs of very fresh fish from the rivers and sea, skewered with vegetables one hardly recognizes  
  - After the soup wines, brought by the Mercy, are opened and guests serve themselves. Very excellent vintage.  
- Players: During the dinner players will learn that they are to depart in the morning, using [**Poku**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ml4MhMjmapNTFYD-ifeZb_XncwotmAcRF9zSmtC7zb0/edit#bookmark=id.3b0n7dpcii1n) as a guide. They might discover:  
  - Poku was recommended by Walcot  
  - He killed the dinner piglet  
- Course2: Suckling forest hog piglet on a spit, which is set in a corner and turned by a servant  
  - Everyone notices the unusual white mark on the forehead of the piglet. It looks almost like a crown.  
  - Fannie, Smith's wife due to Cassare, is a local Fante woman, speaks ill of the Ashanti incursions, and their habit of taking Fante to the slave trade  
  - [Kwad](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ml4MhMjmapNTFYD-ifeZb_XncwotmAcRF9zSmtC7zb0/edit#bookmark=id.9jpa3h3rina8) is offended, but uses very polite and indirect words to argue that the Fante would do the same, and have in fact sold Ga slaves. It is only the superior civilization of the that Ashanti that enable them to occupy the Fante territory around the fort since 1814  
- Desert: Selection of local fruits, root pastes, and so on  
- Entertainment: Fannie recites [Tyger](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/43687/the-tyger), then plays Liszt on piano  
  - Players are invited to demonstrate their talents (Lewis   
- As Smith challenges all comers in Kikogo, an informal negotiation begins; he is good, and experienced at both

## **Negotiation**

As people play Kikogo, Walcot begins a seemingly casual conversation with whomever appears to be the most warlike and leaderly

- Although no slaves are currently traded here, "Ashanti bring Ga slaves to the Portuguese now"  
- Smith, as local leader of the "African Company of Merchants", states that all members abide by the law  
- Will sign the treaty, but only if the Asante shaman Akosua, a member of Tutu's court, is "pacified", because he rouses sentiment against the Dutch  
- Players:  
  - Roll: perceive that Smith has doubts  
  - Roll: Smith knows that slaves are still traded  
  - Roll: The West Africa Patrol has very limited powers \- may only stop ships with actual slaves aboard, not ships that are rigged for slavery  
  - Roll: the Treaty of Vienna already stipulates the Dutch will conform  
  - Roll: the Dutch are merely sick of paying the "Elmina Tribute" of 2 oz gold per month  
  - Roll: A vision that Dutch King William I of the Netherlands will soon sign the Anglo-Dutch Slave Trade Treaty in May 1818  
  - Roll: Akosua actually is using his spiritual position to deter locals from handing over captured enemies as slaves
