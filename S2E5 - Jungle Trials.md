**Journey**: 30 miles up river, then 48 more up the river trail

GM: **Gahan** \- you must discard your untrustable nature at this time, at the demand of Bean. He simply needs to be able to trust you, and you can not continue long if he doesn't know where he stands.

You are introduced to Poku, your young river guide, who brags what a mighty hunter he is for killing the (enormous) piglet.

**Poku's Briefing**

- Stay with me, all the time; don't fall behind  
- If you see a big animal, tell me so that I may kill it

## **To the River** 

[River Map](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gyimi_River#/media/File:Pra_OSM.jpg)

*Arriving at the Pra river delta, the sea is rough and the wind strong. The ship maneuvers carefully to stay in deep water, then weighs anchor. Your team gathers, with Bean, to enter the longboats. Avoiding the rocky shore, you must travel two miles up the river to a Ga village where you may commence the next phase of your journey.*

GM: Roll 4 sneaky/perception: *Bean's silent dwarfish companion is speaking with the quartermasters, arranging to lift something from the hold.* 

*The sea is high. Surging swells top the height of a grown man. The strong wind whips the wave crests into a blowing, eye-stinging spray. Bright sun illuminates the rocking ship, but fog obscures the shore in a dim haze of gray shades. The team steps into the longboat. The order is given by boatswain Chilton to lower away.*

GM: **Roll 3** to avoid throwing up in the swells. Assign who is rowing, and who looks ahead. The boatswain commands.

*Your longboat is deep within the trough between the man-high waves, surrounded by black sparkling water. For just a moment, it tops the swell.* 

GM: Those looking behind **Roll 3** to see:  *At the peaks of the wave you can see the ship you've left behind. Sailors scurry along the rigging, hauling something wide and round above the tossing deck. It glitters in the sun. The figure of Mr. Mump stands on the aftcastle.*

GM: **Roll 3** when a sudden wave strikes the boat to obey Chilton's orders and avoid swamping the boat. If swamped, all must bail and gear will be soggy.

*Your craft enters the shroud of fog. Behind, the ship is gone. Ahead, for the brief moment that the longboat tops the swell, the shore line is barely visible. Fiercely blowing salt spray mixes with tears in the eyes of all who look forward, blurring the scene.*

GM: **Roll 3** to spot: *Your stinging eyes spot a dark shape in the water, perhaps 100 yards away. Like a huge rock that dashes an errant ship, it rises from the water, then rises some more. This is no rock. The hulking shape moves towards your struggling craft.*

ALL: *A bright light pierces the fog above, blinding everyone in a sudden flash of illuminated fog. Squinting your eyes shut, the relentless brightness persists as the longboat dips into a trough, then rises again. A hissing noise erupts nearby, a large splash, and the blinding glare relents. The whipping wind brings a scent of scorched seaweed and flesh to your nostrils.*

GM: **Roll 3** again for another sudden wave. If already swamped, the boat will be overwhelmed and the PCs must make for shore however possible. Equipment will be lost.

*When you reach the mouth of the river the swells grow longer and calmer. Loud jungle noises compete with the calming sea. In a short while, you arrive at the Ga village, a cluster of twelve huts circling a central dirt plaza. A triplet of large, wood-carved statues* [PIC](https://p1.liveauctioneers.com/6938/180845/91007052_1_x.jpg?auto=webp&format=pjpg&quality=80&version=1601918189) *stand guard at the water's edge, where a number of fishing canoes rest.*

GM: Let them get settled. Then a headman comes to them and asks them to seek out Nanampong (three days' travel) to learn whether it is still there, and to seek their wisdom in the matter of the Ashanti king's madness. A brit living there recites the Story of Nanampong, below.

### River Travel

**30 miles**:

* **Native rowers** (10mi/day) may be hired at the mouth of the river Pra, or  
* **Canoes only** may be hired (2mi/day).

Welcomed. Start at once. [Fishermen offer to row](https://i.ebayimg.com/images/g/QYgAAOSwzEpf1nnd/s-l300.jpg). Poku is being paid by the day, so he says one does not need the native rowers. Roll 3 social conflict to determine his motives. The water at the mouth looks very slow because the mouth is so wide. Farther up the water moves more swiftly.

**Daily Water Travel Rolls**

* **Peeing**: The natives pee by just standing in the boat and letting fly. A Brit doing the same must roll 1 or fall in, risking crocs.  
* **Heat**: If rowing, roll for heat as in the jungle.  
* **Fish**: The native fisherman, if they are along, may catch interesting fish.  
* **Tea Time**  
* **Proverb** \- Kwad will use another [Ashanti Proverb](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ml4MhMjmapNTFYD-ifeZb_XncwotmAcRF9zSmtC7zb0/edit#bookmark=id.crn6qbo2vcgz)  
* **Encounter**: roll one per day from the [Jungle River](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ml4MhMjmapNTFYD-ifeZb_XncwotmAcRF9zSmtC7zb0/edit#bookmark=id.fvtkgu497ww2) encounters table.

### Waterfall

At the waterfall everyone must get ready for jungle travel. Natives sit around idly, roasting baboon and hog over campfires. Some eye the party.

* Kobina accuses Kweku of stealing his knife. When Kweku denies it, an aggry bead [PIC](http://www.vam.ac.uk/__data/assets/image/0005/185522/2008bt4161-trade-beads-v2.jpg) is placed in a small vessel [PIC](https://africa.si.edu/collections/internal/media/dispatcher/20784/full;jsessionid=48DC1629D40C8CEB8DEEC016CD904344), with some water.  
* As a neutral party, this vessel is given to a PC.  
* The PC must put his right foot against the right foot of Kweku, who invokes the power of the bead to kill him if he is guilty.  
* Kweku then takes the bead into his mouth with a little of the water, the rest being thrown on the ground, and crossed as Kweku repeats the invocation.  
* Kweku falls to his knees, blood trickles from his nose, and dies. Everyone around seems to accept this.  
* Later, the two come arm in arm. It was a prank, making the party uncertain about what is real, and who is savage.

### Jungle Travel

**8 days**: Travel through 48 miles of heavy jungle. The following stresses must be rolled daily:

**Movement** \- is 10 miles per day on trails, 6 miles per day in jungle with a guide, and 3 miles per day in jungle without a guide.

# PART 9 \=======

**Daily Jungle Travel Rolls**  
**Every Day: Heat \-** see below  
Pick one player per day for a hazard  
Roll an Encounter  
**Roll 1d6:**

1. **Peeing**: Roll 1 to avoid getting separated. A 1 means animal attack.  
2. **Hazards** \- Pick a Jungle hazard per PC. **Roll 4** to avoid it, but see Hazard Rolls below.  
3. **Hunting** \- Each hunter **roll 5** for game, feeding 1d6 people per hunter  
4. **Discovery** \- Each naturalist **roll 5** to discover medicinal [Jungle Flora](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ml4MhMjmapNTFYD-ifeZb_XncwotmAcRF9zSmtC7zb0/edit#bookmark=id.3orkhzdr8gf1)  
5. **Proverb** \- Kwad will use another [Ashanti Proverb](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ml4MhMjmapNTFYD-ifeZb_XncwotmAcRF9zSmtC7zb0/edit#bookmark=id.crn6qbo2vcgz)  
6. **Encounter**

**Hazard Rolls** \- Roll or suffer one random [Jungle Hazard](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ml4MhMjmapNTFYD-ifeZb_XncwotmAcRF9zSmtC7zb0/edit#bookmark=id.bqpcpfi6pu0l) for 3 or more days.

* Avoid: Roll 4 or suffer a hazard; 2 assets if the hazard has been identified and everyone trained to recognize it.  
* Identify: Roll 7 to identify a hazard unknown to you. Ease 2 if it was just experienced.  
* Healing: Effects can be reduced by 1 day per roll 6 healing attempt.

**Guide**:

* A good guide (like Afia) always identifies and trains the PCs in all hazards, and reminds them each morning.

## **Trail to Kumasi**

*Once in the jungle everything changes. You are following the river, and although there is a trail, the going is rough. You never pass anyone else on the trail. Unusual noises of beasts, and birds, assail your ears \- it is so loud that shouting to each other is difficult. It is clear now why you left the boats. The terrain rises and falls, with the river plunging through narrow cataracts, then suddenly leveling into maze-like jungle swamps.*  
The following encounters happen:

Day 1 \- 1mi Bolton collapses; 1/4 movement, Poku killed; scabies Gahan  
Day 2 \- 2mi Throck malaria, TM sank quicksand  
Day 3 \- 2mi \+1 hindrance,   
Day 4 \- 2mi   
Day 5 \- 2mi (bolton still)  
Day 6 \- 4mi   
Day 7 \- 4mi (c) Overnight Black wax dripped on Gahn's eyes, and a horrified grimace on his face.  
Day 8 \- 4mi (c) Spidracula attack.  
Day 9 \- 4mi (c) Gelada  
Day 10 \- 4mi (t fungus)   
Day 11

Day A

* **Poku's Demise**: Sounder of 20 forest hogs. The leader, a huge female 10' long, has a white mark on her forehead as do all her piglets. She takes her revenge on Poku unless the group can stop her.

Day B

* **Hardship**: Roll for hazards. Roll 3 for navigation (following the river). At evening PCs start hearing a **strange call** (the Kikiyaon) following them through the jungle.

@ 24 miles Bean holds conference, Grimaldi moves against Henton, and the Ashanti Attack

@ 30 miles the party starts to hear the Talking Drums \--

# PART 10 \=======

Section:

1. DONE Mr Mump catches up with the party, because they are moving so relatively slow and they are rather trackable. He brings a guide (who will die from Ashanti)  
2. DONE Bolton gets a strange feeling about one of the sailors, Barto.  
3. 24 miles in...  
4. DONE Gahn found unconscious at camp. Black wax is dripped over his eyes. A difficulty 6 will determine that there is a prick in the side of his neck. He opens his mouth and black flies swarm out. Anyone bitten will soon get sleep paralysis.  
5. DONE Bean mentions that in the jungle we are targets for enslavement. At Kumasi, we are guests, especially with the James/Bowdich delegation.  
6. DONE The party passes a Witch Hut. All are told not to look at it. If you don't look at it, the witch won't see you. But if you look... [PIC](https://i.imgur.com/kxupUO5.png) your eyes become "confused" and you see what is not, until the witch takes you. The natives go on about the powers of witches, like stealing your soul after death.  
7. The Ga fishermen take a day to celebrate Homowo, the "hooting at hunger" festival, celebrating the passing of a great famine with a great harvest.  
   1. Ga draw a white circle down the center of their forehead. If you participate you will be magically spared from hunger.  
   2. They beat drums, wrap red spotted bandanas around their foreheads, and drink the bitter Baawoo herbal concoction  
   3. They rip the head right off a chicken, drip the blood on hard boiled eggs, and then toss the chicken and observe it, hoping to learn how to keep away hunger. [VIDEO](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VcPFyOnsiWE&t=13m22s) (warning: it is vile)  
   4. Placing bowls filled with food on their head, the men spin and weave around each other, bending deeply at the knee. Food spirits take possession of them, they start to sweat, eyes rolled, and move in an uncontrolled manner.  
   5. The food is dumped in a sacred place. Some stomp upon it while others rush to collect some and eat. Fighting breaks out, posturing and pushing.  
8. During this Bean has a meeting to discuss Gahn's condition, and after everyone starts to leave...  
   1. Henton will be assassinated by Grimaldi. A sailor dances up to him. He realizes at the last moment it is Barto, and sees dark ink swimming in his eyes. Barto reaches out, a ring on his finger.  
   2. Moira will save him. Standing above him in a tree, he will see her empty a skull of some strange material (it is Barto's skull, collected after Grimaldi disposed of him, which gives he witchy sympathy to his spirit). That will cause Grimaldi to grimace, retching up needles and wool.  
   3. Bolton will see Grimaldi changing. He has been one of the sailors the whole time.  
9. Grimaldi is caught, or killed. He will collapse. As the party gathers he bursts open, releasing flies and his skin will slink off into the jungle.  
10. Everyone bitten must roll diff 8 or fall into sleep paralysis. Coin gives an asset. Constance will be assaulted by shark-birds, not attacked, but they will come land on her. Each one will only attack if attacked. Otherwise they just sit there.  
11. Ashanti attack.  
    1. The forest goes quiet. You hear this: [VIDEO](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4ozAB3SsdI&t=47s)  
    2. Brits may counter with: [VIDEO](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQrE8vOM0ss&t=270s)  
    3. Ashanti warriors are running down the porters, entangling them in nets and carrying them off.  
    4. Some are seen with desiccated hands gripping their left shoulders. **Roll 4** Alchemical/Reagents to note the Blue Vitriol dripping from them.  
    5. The Ga are seen to be running slowly, or staring dumbly stock still. **Roll 3** Spirit Sight to can see dark, smokey spirits overwhelming the minds of the Ga.  
12. Ashanti attack the group, chanting a war chant.  
13. Mr. Mump [PIC](https://i.imgur.com/4UbRGNz.jpeg) uses a plant spirit to create the illusion of jungle over the characters after slaying about three Ashanti warriors.  
    1. Three TMs stay with Bolton, showing deep loyalty. Bully Buster [PIC](https://i.imgur.com/R4sRxQ2.png), Josephus Bragg [PIC](https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-htHQ5zTyM-Q/UuQeRIEC4bI/AAAAAAAAA1I/uY9rIHMV_vk/s1600/Stocking_Merchant_1759.jpg), and American Dick [PIC](https://c7.alamy.com/comp/AAME1G/19th-century-engraving-of-old-time-sailor-holding-sextant-next-to-AAME1G.jpg).  
    2. Kobina stays [PIC](https://i.imgur.com/Gihqs1Q.jpeg). Kweku [PIC](https://i.imgur.com/wFVk2MW.png) dies saving the PCs.  
    3. Mump presses a ring into Lucius' paralized hand saying "You wanted you to have this, I think."  
    4. Mump also leaves them with three [Congreve Rockets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congreve_rocket), which are a cypher to frighten enemies.  
    5. Bean says  
       1. "If we get separated I will meet you at Kumasi. You can rely upon it."  
       2. "If we don't meet again... Napoleon knew, but it couldn't save him."  
14. Bean and Mump, and some TMs, use Congreve rockets to scare Ashanti from the hiding place, and then make a ruckus to draw off the remaining Ashanti.

The group is rescued by the **Austra.**

Day 4

* **Ashanti Raid**: an overwhelming force of Ashanti come and basically split the party with Bean (putting on the gold helmet and attracting attention) heroically risking his life to save the players. Many bearers are captured as slaves, but most of the Ashanti are diverted by Bean.  
* Arrive at **Nanampong**.
