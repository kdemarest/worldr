# Scenario: Zayan Ruins

### Austra

See the Austra living in harmony with nature in every way, yet a very high quality of life. The exception is that the individual is allowed to risk and die, always in favor of the community.

When the austra rescue the players, it's a big moment for Henton because they bring everyone back to Stone ruins of an ancient civilization, but also the incredibly carefully patiently cultured trees that make up their current civilization.

The austra are humaniform but not human \- they share a common ancestor, but cognitively they won't take actions that harm the broader world (to the extent they can perceive that). They will kill anything that upsets the natural order upon which they depend, so for example gold mining, smelting iron etc.

They live incredibly simply, and they have merely taken up residence in an archaeologically interesting place. Perhaps that place has something to do with brother Lucius and his time travel and why his cross and book were found on the floating island. It seems to me that there must be some sort of a perfect animal spirit involved.

### People

* **Throckmorton and Gahan**, if they use the Observatory, come to understand that the laws of nature are incorrect. That is, fundamental physical and chemical interactions have been altered by an outside force of some kind. (the corruptor)  
* **Moira** shows up at the Austra village, dressed all in a modest white chemise and skirt [PIC](https://armstreet.com/catalogue/full/full-snow-white-dress-set-chemise-corset-skirt-and-underskirt-with-lace-9.jpg). She discloses that she has been following Henton since Cape Coast Castle, and eventually goes on to tell her story, below.  
* **Henton** gathers archaeological evidence, Bolton collects anthro, Lucius decipers stone-carved script, Constance and/or Gahan enter trapped areas to recover stone tablets of knowledge. Throckmorton creates a concoction that includes \<reagents\> that opens the minds to receive impossible knowledge.  
* **DONE Lucius**: sees the [statue of the Aristocrat](https://cdnb.artstation.com/p/assets/images/images/018/536/969/medium/poligone-cg-1.jpg?1559749145). Feels somehow familiar, and noble.  
* **Lucius** comes to understand it is in fact St. Benedict inside the ring. This explains how he could have collaborated with St Thomas Aquinas on the bible revisions. And it would shed light on some of the claims that Moira will make about her Waldensian history.  
* **DONE Gahan**: A young, local tribal woman [PIC](http://beauty-around.com/images/sampledata/Himba_Women/1himba_woman.jpg) sneaks into the Austra village. She seeks to sleep with Gahan. She can be spotted leaving at 4 in the morning. Moira may eventually sleep with Gahan, as part of the secret breeding program.  
* **DONE Constance**: The [aged warrior](https://cdna.artstation.com/p/assets/images/images/006/689/308/medium/aaron-sims-creative-asc-pota3-spear-v29-09-30-15.jpg?1500492880) shows her the meaning of dexterity and evasion \- but it isn't pure dex; there is a mental trick involved, and she needs to get good at it. Also the capability to save or help others in a fight.  
* **Bolton:** Learns about the advanced culture and civilization from [Ook](https://cdna.artstation.com/p/assets/images/images/006/689/308/medium/aaron-sims-creative-asc-pota3-spear-v29-09-30-15.jpg?1500492880). Perhaps it charts a course towards the future of the Empire. Throckmorton helps connect cleanliness with disease; The importance of science becomes apparent. The ability to interconnect people with instant communication. Servant machines. Gain "aura of civility" to establish credibility with rulers and muckity mucks you've never met.

### Habits

* Before **sunrise** a meal is served. Everyone sits around taking their leisure, speaking, and sharing news of their families.  
* At **sunrise**, the Shapers move about tending the many trees, coaxing them into shapes by stroking them with their hands. Others tend the jungle farm fruit trees, roots and so on. There is no "growing season" \- it all grows all the time.  
* At **noon** the Austra practice 'war games' in which the objective seems to be to go undetected, or defend oneself against attack. It looks like attacking at first, but soon all becomes clear.  
* At **sunset**, many of the Austra stand upon high points on the ruins, and sing.  
  * They sing about the tragedy and nobility of sacrificing one's life to avert subjugation of sentients and nature. [VIDEO](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4oZZhpMXP4)  
  * They protect their place from a baleful gaze. [VIDEO](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ob-b0h9tHR0) An astute observer will note that there is a rearranged spot in the sky where the planet Jupiter would be.  
  * They entertain their guests with the Requiem Lacrimosa [VIDEO](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1-TrAvp_xs)

### Places

* [PIC](https://cdnb.artstation.com/p/assets/images/images/022/226/325/large/jithendra-pedhamalla-day-view.jpg?1574613782) \- from a distance  
* [PIC](https://cdna.artstation.com/p/assets/images/images/026/877/544/large/jeremy-chopin-chopin-jeremy-compo-day.jpg?1589978601) \- a place in the village. The head wears symbolic gold.  
* **Sanctum** [PIC](https://cdna.artstation.com/p/assets/images/images/020/671/422/large/adrian-virlan-3spirittemple-presentation-adrianvirlan.jpg?1569251980) (as seen with spirit vision) \- where an ever-changing icon of ideal nature holds a pan of water infused with a city's worth of spirits. In the back is the Library.  
* **Observatory** \- There is a mighty observatory, with a huge brass telescope in complete disrepair. An eyepiece may be gathered and used to focus spirit at a corrupt enemy. A map shows the location of nearby observation capabilities. Searching through the rubble, one finds a photo of men in white lab coats, standing together posed. One has a long beard and gray hair, and looks remarkably like Brother Lucius. They hold a drawing of Jupiter with only **four storms**, meaning there were only four wards at the time of their work. Also a KEY (see COMBAT)  
* **Globe** \- Deep below the observatory there is a Celestial Globe [PIC](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e8/Beijing_Ancient_Observatory_20090715-03.jpg) [PIC](http://licsundial.net/wp-content/beijing_obs2.jpg) that maps the sky. Also, making a paper copy of the iron centerpiece enables the user to adapt to stonehenge itself once in England; all part of making the New God. One can also find this: [PIC](https://images.e-flux-systems.com/183082_8ab95f7d56d963c8f1daee995f98582c.jpg,1440)  
* **Henge Ziggurat** \- A short walk down the valley, beside a river clearing, on a ziggurat, are stones that look a lot like Stonehenge [PIC](https://www.astronomytrek.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Was-Stonehenge-an-Ancient-Observatory-634x381.jpg) with the "missing link" from the Beijing Ancient Observatory [PIC](https://assets.atlasobscura.com/media/W1siZiIsInVwbG9hZHMvcGxhY2VfaW1hZ2VzLzA4NjM1MzY4MTU0Y2YxYTY4Zl84MDBweC1CZWlqaW5nX0FuY2llbnRfT2JzZXJ2YXRvcnlfMjAwOTA3MTUtMDcuanBnIl0sWyJwIiwidGh1bWIiLCJ4MzkwPiJdLFsicCIsImNvbnZlcnQiLCItcXVhbGl0eSA4MSAtYXV0by1vcmllbnQiXV0) in the middle. Seeing this, a scientist would realize that the iron construction in the center must unlock the true key to using stonehenge.  
* **Rusted Hulk** \- By the riverside are the remains of a heavily resulted automaton.  
* **Meditation Chamber** \- Below the Sanctum a door unlocked by the Observatory's key circle of bones. **COMBAT** servant robots.  
* **Library** \- at the back of the Sanctum behind a well concealed door; contains rows and rows of thin, rectangular mica tablets color coded into groups. Shake them a bit and they light up with runes. East wall touch it and a huge map of the ruined city illuminates in delicate traceries. West wall contains a key to the color coding of the tablet sections: Secrets, Medical, Construction, Technology, Military (all about using automatons) etc.  
* **Guide Room** \- You can find a small lith inscribed with the rune for Medical. Inside is much complex and inscrutable equipment, but most importantly:  
  * **Guide Helm** \- counterweighted, it can be put on by anyone easily. With the Reader you can rapidly learn and do whatever it is you need. Some knowledge (the Secrets) will be retained. Most knowledge (Military and Medical) will be lost, unless it is "adjacent" to your current base of knowledge.  
  * **Exosuit** \- looks like a chair below the Helm, until the Slab you're perusing needs it to move. Then it snaps itself onto you and you can, for example, move to the surgery table to perform a surgery.   
  * **Reader** \- put a mica tablet inside. It wraps around the front cylinder of the machine, suddenly going from rigid to flexible. Whatever is read puts the Guide wearer into a metaphorical landscape.  
  * **Surgery** \- a table with robot arms above it. Combined with the right Slab you can do amazing medical procedures.  
* **Guidance** \- Using the helm for guidance one must first make a difficulty 2 "compatibility roll". A 1 means temporary insanity. Missing means try tomorrow. Henton's spirit sensitivity means that he does not have to make a compatibility role. It may be revealed that Gahan not only doesn't have to make a roll but cannot benefit from using the machine at all.  
* **Secrets Metaphor** \- One only reaches this via the Helm.  A landscape of mountains to be climbed. Only one (the tablet's technique) is climbable, at a cost of 4exp.

## **Automatons**

They are big brass men, with some parts that glow. Their heads have the same shape as the Inventor's sideburns. They are aware of each other via that helmet shape and the material of the helmets. They are aware of living forms due to heat and heartbeat.

Anyone wearing an automaton helmet may move freely among them, as long as they don't harm them. Such a helmet can be found on the Rusted Hulk, and a small one in the Guide Room.

### Austra Events

* Wise men come, fleeing to the village.  
  * Their sanctuary, composed of elders from many local tribes (including Ashanti) has been attacked. They take you to Nanampong.  
  * Meet exiled Ashanti Soul Washer (a beautiful young man Akrafo). He says the king has lost his way. He joins Kwad to replenish his powers instead of the King.  
* They take you to an abandoned Ashanti slaving outpost. [PIC](https://brewminate.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/072620-53-History-Africa-Ghana.jpg) Inside, you find useful clues to the sway the Ashanti are under.  
* Throckmorton's Meditator tells that the Austra are content to let the world die at the hands of man.  
* The party learns that mental defenses can be erected against the corruption invading the Ashanti. The darker your spirit, the more difficult it is.

### Secrets

* The main secret is that they build servant robots who ultimately killed them all, and really, it is because they spoke secrets openly and bad luck tweaked the bots.

# PART 12 \=======

Operation on Bolton's hand, giving him an Arc Light that he can focus, and a 15' grappling hook that can grab (and disarm), but not attack.

# PART 13 \=======

GM:

* Bolton: The brass hand suffers from Witness Effect  
* Throckmorton/Gahan \- discover meteor  
* Moira teaches Henton "Reality Discipline" for 3xp (a discount for his contact).  
* Tenets in Lucius' "Word of Benedict":  
  * Some malefic force is working against humanity  
  * It has suborned Catholic leadership. Only through the actions of Napoleon were   
  * The Benedictines have created their own layer to hide "within the system" to strive against this threat  
  * Saint Benedict was the first person to perceive this corruption, and thus he founded the Order of Benedictine Monks  
  * The Benedictine vow is actually against this malefic force: stability, fidelity to the monastic way of life, and obedience  
* Benedictine Philosophy  
  * Only God can determine the Fate of Humanity. That is why he gave us Free Will. The malefactions of corruption *always* threaten the Doom of Man. To accept such oppression unfought is to give the baleful eye an easy victory.  
* The ring brings everyone to the Massacre of Merindol.  
  * Peaceful, non-violent people are slaughtered for their belief that everyone has a relationship with God.  
  * The Pope is invoked as swords are driven into the bellies of pregnant women  
* Spirit Defenses  
  * Trained: a roll every round to resist, with appropriate bonus  
  * Specialized: same

### Pius VII at a Crossroads

*Pius VII joined the declaration of the Congress of Vienna, in 1815, urging the suppression of the slave trade. By now the major consistent opposition to this came from Spain and Portugal, to whose empires a continued supply of new slaves remained economically very important. In the United States the slave population was largely able to maintain its numbers, and even many slave-owners accepted the evils of the African slave-trade and the need to abolish it.*

*Pius wrote letters to the restored King of France in 1814 and the King of Portugal in 1823 urging the same thing. By now the Papacy was under political pressure from the British government, as British support was needed at the Congress of Vienna for the restoration of the Papal States.*

### Moira's Story

*I am a Waldensian, as it is said in English. We advocate non-violence. We believe that anyone can share the word of God.*

*We know that there is a baleful influence corrupting human nature, and that the Lord's word is key to saving humanity.*

*I knew Pierre Valdus [PIC](https://museeprotestant.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/0000000324L.jpg). He was a great man, a disciple to Benedeto, and a great reader of the stars. He was also a good friend and guide to Edward, may he rest in peace.*

GM: 500 years apart, so either Waldo lived a LONG time, or Benedeto did). 

*Valdus had the New Testament translated into Provencal, spoken widely at the time. His ideas spread all over Europe. But Valdus and his disciples, “the Poor of Lyon“, were declared heretics by the Roman Catholic Church, mostly because in their community lay people, including women, were allowed to preach.*

*Believing one is god's chosen leads down a dark road of callous disregard. And we know that God's Testament is filled with knowledge that can save us all.*

*No, I don't ride a broom, that is silly. Only men ride brooms. Take the priest Guillaume Edelin. Four hundred years ago they tried him for witchcraft after he criticized the church’s warnings about witches. They torched him until he confessed, then imprisoned him for life.*

GM:

* Constance knows Waldensians welcomed Napoleon and the Bonapartists. 20 years freed from their ghettos, and given  "freedom of Conscience" until 1815\. But when the Congress of Vienna restored the King of Sardinia he reinstated all restrictive laws.  
* Gahan experienced Waldensian preachers in London, called “barbes” (i.e. “uncles”, so as not to be confused with the Catholic “fathers”) who travel throughout Europe regularly visiting their small underground groups of followers.  
* Henton's inventor friend Oliver is a collector of Bibles. He has shown Henton the well-known Olivetan Bible, translated by Waldensians from Latin into the French.  
* Bolton's friend Tawnsy used to say, from a political perspective, the King James "oath of civil obedience" was wielded against Waldensians (and Catholics) to drive them from England.  
* Throckmorton's great aunt Sissy, of French descent, calls them the Vaudois. She still tells the story of the Massacre of Merindol where their ancestors died. Jean Maynier's church inquisition slaughtered 2,000 Waldensians, reduced 23 villages to rubble, and sent 700 to the galleys. His mother never approved of Sissy, and showed him this: [PIC](https://i2.wp.com/streetsofsalem.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/flying-waldensians-martin-le-france.jpg?resize=443%2C600)  
* Lucius will understand the Waldensians as great heretics and magical witches. Pope Lucius III, of the Papacy in Avignon, excommunicated them in 1184 for witchcraft. Pope [Paul III](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_III) approved of the Massacre and rewarded Maynier with Imperial honours. That history was later annotated with this [PIC](https://i1.wp.com/streetsofsalem.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/flying-waldensians-2-johannes-tinctor-traite-du-crime-de-vauderie-1460.jpg?resize=490%2C676)  
* \[\[An Austra states that the galley slaves should have killed themselves rather than advance the interests of evil men.\]\]

[Waldensian Notes](https://museeprotestant.org/en/notice/a-history-of-the-waldensians/)

### Waldensian Beliefs

GM: In game terms, Valdus arose as a great man conscious of the Corruptor and shielded from him much as Gahan is. He came to understand that the Bible is a REVERSE translation code to understand certain magical writings (like what Lucius is translating) and therefore sought to spread it everywhere. Of course, the Corrupted Pope didn't like that.

* evangelical radicalism, based on the ‘sermon on the mount‘ which led them to refuse to take the oath of civil obedience, that is, they would not swear allegiance to civil authority over the authority of God. \[\[in fact, they won't swear oaths to anyone seeming to be influenced by the corruptor\]\]  
* By implication, laymen may have a personal relationship with God  
* They contested the institutional Church of Rome : they were against the papacy and also the power and wealth of the Church ;  
* They rejected purgatory and indulgences together with the cult of saints  
* They believed in travelling preachers : preaching was carried out by laymen called « Barbes » (« uncle » in piedmontese, that is to say, an elder). They were unmarried. They had trades which forced them to travel frequently. Because of persecution, preaching was done in private houses and not in the public square.

# Nanampong

* It is empty. An Eye Gem (as from the London black skull) is placed over the door of each hut, held in a woven vine mesh. **Henton** can see that each imprisons an uncommunicative spirit within it's hut. 

*At Nanampong (Nanan means a grand-father) near Mankasim, in the Braffoo country, there is a deep dell, inhabited by a number of aged fetish men, whom the Fantees believe to be immortal, and to have lived there beyond all memory, in close con- verse with the fetish, and ignorant of the world but by intuition. The spirits of the aged and wise are believed to dwell amongst them, and their prophecies and advice are revered as emanations from the fetish. Adookoo, the chief of the Braffoos, used sometimes to consult them in person, but generally through his head fetishman, and the Fantees now attribute the successes of the Ashantees, and their own defeats and misfor- tunes, to the disregard of what the oracle enjoined ; for, whilst it was obeyed, they say the country always prospered ; and, indeed, from the instances which have been reported to me, the responses appear to have directed a just and prudent policy, highly conducive to the welfare of Fantee. This dell is so impervious, and yet so capacious, that many hundred Fantees were secreted there, during the Ashantee invasions, which these priests had predicted. The house or temple of the principal fetish of the Ahanta country, called Checquoo, is at Apremmadoo, about four miles up theTakaradee river : upwards of fifty superior priests are resident there.*

# **PART 14 \=======**

Brother Lucius wounds incapacitate him substantially and as he is carried through the jungle he has time for contemplation. He realizes that he has the power to  
\* Shield people from evil/curses  
\* Remove possession/curses  
\* Expend 1i to go unnoticed (similar to Gahan, but Gahan's is free)  
\* Undo evil moments (time manipulation and mental manipulation are related. It is all about belief)

The Bible is his decryption mechanism, and passages within hold the key to training his mind to more rapidly encrypt and decrypt, which are skills he can take with experience points.

Lucius can spend 5i to undo one action (PC death for example). This always costs at least 1i despite edge. But he can only do it once per action.

# Corridors

* Air (birds)  
* Earth (Statues)  
* Water (Zocto)

## Air Corridor

Metallic birds  
Crab insects that pull them apart  
High surface tension fruit squoze from the intersections of the "plants"  
A display shows a much more organic version, that explains the ecosystem  
Sinuses are really dry \- the whole key is that the metals will corrode  
Air moves a lot

Lots of mechanical birds. They are each works of art. But the most interesting part is that the mechanical birds both breed and heal. They can't really leave the ecosystem, which provides a nuclear radiant power source for them, but of course one could carry them out.

Bird can translate Zayan.

* Bird and English and translation  
* Bible  
* Bird does not want to be examined.

## Earth Corridor

Statues going back in time

## Water Corridor

Menagerie  
Automaton aviary  
3 12' wide hallways, 24' tall

**Zayan**

* 75% of phonemes do not match English  
* Writing is symbolic and generally phonemic, composing characters into words. However, the diacritic marks are plentiful, and the letter symbols combine to form new pseudo-symbols that expand meaning, much like German Komposita.

**Water**  
24' plexiglass wall

* Blind cave fish [PIC](https://i.natgeofe.com/n/ed689395-8c60-4625-b8ff-db64ffa26841/cavefish.jpg)  
* Jellyfish called "Jerrish" [PIC](https://media.wired.com/photos/5b50d5f5f9e98c0b2b9625ed/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/Deiopea-kaloktenota.jpg)  
* Octopoids called the "Zocto"  
* Hot water from volcanic vents warps the water  
* Red plants \- some of which are volcanic worms

The audio is broadcast directly into your ears, perfect UI, so if you cover one ear it simply mutes audio to that ear.

**Exhibit 1**

* Exhibit 1 you touch the glass and the thing is highlighted and you're told about it. You might be invited to "interact" to learn more  
* Also on that exhibit, if you choose the jellyfish, you can give (Zayan) commands and those will make it to the Jerrish. If you pronounce well enough (roll 5\) it will work.

**Spirits**

* There is an AI running the exhibit. It is capable of learning a language in order to serve its function, which is, explaining the exhibit, enabling pet-like commands to the Jerrish, and translating for conversations with the Zocto.  
* Beyond that, it really doesn't do much. It is purpose-built AI.  
* Rolling a 1 will make the AI alert, and it will ask for identification  
* The spirit "tastes" strange. Not human.

## Zocto (exhibit 2\)

[PIC](https://i.pinimg.com/736x/71/99/e0/7199e02ba317b4ba6294a273466ef86a--octopus-decor-octopus-art.jpg) [Mature](https://i.pinimg.com/736x/71/84/9c/71849c2792d0526e7a186455ffbdfbf5--steampunk-sunglasses-hand-blown-glass.jpg)  [Old](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0874/2892/products/IMG_2859.JPG?v=1449076244)  [Children](https://www.crystal-fox.com/webart/products_large/8407.jpg) [Armored](https://www.bronze-sculpture-art.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/01/osmiornica-steampunk-szkatulka.jpg)  
Around the corner is a big, amphitheatre-like area, with a 60'x40' glass wall looking upon a big Zocto "city". About 30 will be visible at any time, but a total of 120 live there.

Touch the wall and Zayan communication opens.

**Communication**

* Can be verbal (properly pronounced) Zayan or in drawings.  
* If prompted, a mechanical bird will come and learn your language. See AI above for mitations.  
* Their method of "speaking" is very hard to detect. It is vibration of their suckers to send a vibe wave through the water.  
* However, "tentacle shapes" indicate emotions.  
* Those same shapes, simplified, are the basis of their writing, always with eight strokes, and always a shape that can be made with tentacles.

**Sights:**

* One uses a kind of sharpened stone to make images, stipling with its six 'minor' limbs which the two 'major' limbs hold and position the shell  
* 6 carry one to a funerary door inset within a cliff-like iris door.  
* Translucent little children/babies with huge heads hover around their caretakers, always in groups and never alone  
* Mottled, saggy elders  
* Females have beaks, but males don't  
* Mathematicians have beaded necklaces that act like abacus.

**Encounter**

* An artist comes and shows a portrait of a player  
* Elders are summoned. Center is the leader, left is rather impatient and wants to know what happened to the Zayans for so long. Right is against the prophecy of a Zayan return and will try to make things go poorly.  
* "Legends tell that one will return and speak to us."

**Zocto**

The Zocto are only found deep in the earth, in the general environs of volcanic vents, where they make their own light and use the light of their Jerrish pets. Normal Zocto are primitive, unable to progress in culture due to the ceaseless pressure of predators and natural disruption.

The Zocto in the Zayan exhibit have been left alone for a thousand years, developing their own sophisticated culture due to the safety of their situation.

They write upon shells to keep history, so have large yet limited books.

They are artists, architects, builders, teachers, and dancers. They are not warlike, generally preferring to cooperate against their major predators, which include:

* Yeti crabs [PIC](https://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/alexsteffen/pages/187/attachments/original/1429922947/Yeti_Crab.jpg?1429922947)  
* Fast Gulper Eels [PIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pelican_eel#/media/File:Eurypharynx_pelecanoides.jpg)  
* Deep sea toad angler [PIC](https://i.redd.it/n5sdi02r3qz41.jpg) so nearly invisible they are hard to evade  
* Deeps sea polyoculus [PIC](https://mir-s3-cdn-cf.behance.net/project_modules/max_1200/b8f21573153417.5bffe572792e0.jpg)

# PART 15 \=======

Open Question: How does the Corruptor feel about the Zocto? Are the Zocto aware it exists, and are they targeted?

Guide Chair \- lets you see lots of spectrum; very heavy  
They will survive 200 years in the elements, and 50+-25 

* They jammed sticks into the reader "slot"  
* The chair and tablet reader are stuck in a river bed near the meteor strike zone  
* The guide helmet is in Throckmorton's possession

# PART 16 \=======

# Jungle Journey

## Finding Dash

The party finds the ship's dog near the rotting body of a sailor. It is clear from the bag that he was smuggling Dash through the jungle. Now Dash is loyally staying beside his corpse.

## Ants

**Ants**: *An ibis-like creature (waterbuck [PIC](https://www.awf.org/sites/default/files/styles/vertical_image/public/2020-04/Website_SpeciesPage_Waterbuck03_01_Solutions.jpg?h=3c6d87fa&itok=UmGjgIvt)) grazes peacefully in a small clearing ahead. Nearby, a waterfall rushes and plunges, masking the noise of your movement. The air is still. A porter named Yaaba unslings his bow, stalks forward. Intent on the buck, Yaaba suddenly looks down. His face is pointed away, so you can't see his expression, but he lets out a despairing moan, startling the buck. He begins to flail about, then falls screaming.* 

GM: Army ants [PIC](https://news.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/kronaueretalarmyants5.jpg) are consuming him. It is risky to help. The group will have to figure out how to cross their trail without getting skeletonized.

## Afia

**Kikiyaon**: More hazards. All day the strange call persists. Kikiyaon \- see description for consequences. When the players get in trouble, **Kofi** and **Afia** appear.

**Afia**: Akyem King [Kofi Asante Akyem](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ml4MhMjmapNTFYD-ifeZb_XncwotmAcRF9zSmtC7zb0/edit#bookmark=id.vvyu4u4wjxsd) offers a guide/warrior, his daughter [Afia Dokuaa](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ml4MhMjmapNTFYD-ifeZb_XncwotmAcRF9zSmtC7zb0/edit#bookmark=id.gk2nlxa7zscd). If they accept she gives them **Afia's Briefing** [LINK](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ml4MhMjmapNTFYD-ifeZb_XncwotmAcRF9zSmtC7zb0/edit#bookmark=id.li04r27s5gdx) and then guides them. Her speech sounds like this: [VIDEO](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAhK_HlNNJM)

**Distraction**: Bean seeks to have Twum make a false Akyem attack to distract Ashanti, but Bean doesn't succeed. The party may choose to bargain for it.

# Gelada Cliffs

* Make daily rolls.  
* Party should find a Gelada drying house, and a Smith making metal charms. The drying house is where the skulls are being dried, adorned with metal, and gem eyed.  
* At the cliff a slave mine digging up eye gems.   
* *You enter a deeper shadow. The sun is obscured by tall cliffs, rising above the canopy of the jungle. Desperate trees and bifurcating vines cling to the cliff sides. Strange calls can be heard above, but the higher regions are shrouded by mist. Something is moving on the cliffs. Many somethings. 'This is the easiest way up,' says Afia, but it doesn't look easy. You glance at the mules, heavily laden with gear.*  
* All must climb the rocky 200' cliffs. The mules must be unloaded, hauled up the cliff, and re-loaded.  
  * **Baboons** (see Jungle Encounters) inhabit these cliffs, descending from their safety each morning to feed in the jungle trees.

### Encounters: Gelada Cliffs

1. Giant Gelada [PIC](https://i.imgur.com/d7G2AOK.jpg)   
2. Baby Geladas want to play, and steal PC gear. But mama might get angry.  
3. X Leopard *crouches in a hollow in the cliff ahead of you, eyeing you, ready to pounce. Suddenly, behind you, three large male baboons drop, bellowing anger and demonstrating their blood red chests.* If you just get out of the way, they will grab the leopard and throw it down the cliff.  
4. X Mine Entrance there are slaves digging gems from within the cliffside. Large Gelada males casually sit at the entrance, eating. They are clearly guards.  
5. X Territorial Male thinks you are in his territory. He can leap 30' at will, and drop down 50' and simply grab something and hang from it. He is 4x as strong as a human. His eyes give the impression that he was once a man.  
6. Rival Faction of baboons comes from the eastern cliffs. There is fighting, echoing screams of rage. How will the PCs react?  
* *Near the top the cliffs get shear. You must turn to the side, walking on a mat of enclosing vines (as in Thailand). Below you is nothing. Only the density of the vines holds you up.*  
* Transition back to Jungle at the cliff tops.

## Slaver Party

* [Dahomey](http://theleagueofextraordinaryladies.com/2015/05/mino-the-dahomey-amazons/) [PIC](http://theleagueofextraordinaryladies.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/dahomey4.jpg) [PIC](http://theleagueofextraordinaryladies.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/dahomey1.jpg) [PIC](http://theleagueofextraordinaryladies.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/56-195939-dahomey1.jpg) slave-capture party, possibly twenty to 100 strong? They might already have slaves and be returning east towards Benin, and so only a limited number pursue the PCs. They call themselves Mino. Amazon African women from the Benin area who fight with spear, musket and three foot long razor sharp two-handed machete. Part of their training exercises consisted of giving weapons to captured enemies, and then literally hunting them through the jungle. To the bloody death. *Barefoot*. The Mino motto was *Conquer or Die*, and they meant it. Only the king himself could order a Mino to retreat from battle; if she ran from the front lines for any other reason, she would be summarily executed by one of her sisters on the spot. They wear thorn belts that intentionally pierce their skin.
