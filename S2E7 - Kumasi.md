## **Kumasi**

[About Ashanti Culture](https://scholarworks.uark.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2979&context=jaas)

*Up ahead you hear the murmur of many voices and the grunt of small pigs. A large village containing hundreds of huts comes into view. Peering out from the forest canopy, you make out a stone palace perhaps three stories tall in the distance. Nearby, dwarf pigs roll in the mud as a teen aged girl brings them slop. Around her arm is a bangle of what appears to be solid gold. Her father calls to her in a language you do not recognize. He wears a golden necklace, and at his waist a dagger with a gold inlaid pommel is visible. Walking along the street, servants hold a large umbrella above the head of a woman in colorful fabric and gold.* [PIC](https://media.gettyimages.com/photos/coomassie-ashanti-war-africa-1900-a-view-of-kumasi-in-the-gold-coast-picture-id463961305?s=2048x2048)

GM: Arrive [Kumasi](https://media.gettyimages.com/photos/coomassie-ashanti-war-africa-1900-a-view-of-kumasi-in-the-gold-coast-picture-id463961305?s=2048x2048). see sophistication, peace, wealth ([ewer](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/fc/Ashanti_English_Medieval_Ewer.jpg/427px-Ashanti_English_Medieval_Ewer.jpg))

## **Town Encounters**

**Culture**

* Observe sophisticated [culture](https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/35/gallery/)  
* See peace, wealth ([ewer](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/fc/Ashanti_English_Medieval_Ewer.jpg/427px-Ashanti_English_Medieval_Ewer.jpg))  
* Massive 300km hammer-drums [PIC](http://www.asiasociety.org/files/story/images/101004_huge_drum_delhi.jpg)  
* Tall-peaked roofs, clay patterns on building walls  
* Weavers, wood carvers of talking drums, statues or fertility dolls  
* Ceramic pots & pipes, kente cloth making, metallurgy

**Funeral**

* That evening, see the funeral of a **Caboceer** (slaving leader) wherein three men and three women are sacrificed to accompany him in the after life. Kente cloth is being worn. Nobody weeps. They clearly are going through the motions, but are not invested.

**People**

* A **scribe** wearing a golden torque-of-office on his wrist strolls past.  
* White powder shaker. You notice that the white powder isn't exactly random on her body. It seems to form into faces. A couple brings their child, who stole, to her. Elevating the symbol of the king, she orders the child's hand to be chopped off.

1. **Dancers:** Throckmorton also should come upon little monkey bodies with human heads crudely sewn onto them dancing around one night in the moonlight. They are filled with blue vitriol. Already-dead bodies are in the clearing, suicides who resisted enslavement. The Monkeys behead them, then begin to scoop matter out of the skulls to eat.

## **Bean's Briefing**

GM: Bean informs you that:

* You must put these coins of St. Benedict (or Edward the Confessor) under your tongues and keep them there at all times.  
* A gold casket was commissioned months ago by the Benedictines. He must examine it. The forge is a good place to start looking. (it is in the treasury)  
* You must find the tomb entrance and make ready to enter it.  
* You must kidnap the [King](https://media.gettyimages.com/photos/kofi-karikari-king-of-ashanti-ghana-third-angloashanti-war-from-the-picture-id933445898?s=2048x2048) and put him in the gold coffin.  
* Enter the tomb and shatter the Black Relic.

## **Negotiation**

*"Tell the white men," said the King, " what they have done made me much pleasure; I was glad to be friends; but today I see they come to put shame upon my face; this breaks my heart too much. The English know, with my own powder, with my own shot, I drove the Fantees under their forts, I spread my word over them, they were all killed, and their books from the fort are mine. I can do as much for the English as the Fantees, they know this well, they know I have only to send a captain to get all the heads of the Fantees. These white men cheat me, they think to make 'Shantee fool ; they pretend to make friends with me, and they join with the Fantees to cheat me, to put shame upon my face ; this makes the blood come from my heart." This was reported by his Linguist with a passion of gesture and utterance scarcely inferior to the King's ; the irritation spread throughout the circle, and swelled even to uproar*

*The Moors of authority seized the moment, and zealously fanned the flame which encircled us ; for the King looking in vain for those testimonies of British feeling which presence of mind would have imposed, exclaimed, as he turned his ear from the Moors, "I know the English come to spy the country ; they come to cheat me ; they want war, they want war."*

*Mr. James said "No\! We want trade." The King impatiently continued, "They join the Fantees to put shame upon my face ; I will send a captain to-morrow to take these books, and bring me the heads of all the Fantees under the forts ; the white men know I can do this, I have only to speak to my captains.*

*"The Dutch Governor does not cheat me ; he does not shame me before the Fantees ; he sends me the whole 4 oz, a month. The Danes do not shame me, and the English 4 ackies a month is nothing to me ; I can send a captain for all ; they wish war." He drew his beard into his mouth, bit it, and rushing abruptly from his seat exclaimed, " Shantee fool\! Shantee fool\! ah\! ah\!" then shaking his finger at us with the most angry aspect, would have burst from us with the exclamation," If a black man had brought me this message, I would have had his head cut off before me."*

Bowdich steps in and makes an impassioned speech. The tide begins to turn

## **Palace**

[MAP](https://i.imgur.com/HhD1PS5.jpeg) (by Ken) \- the palace is 200' across. 20 pots are cooked in the kitchen at a time. The rooms are enormous.

The palace has an entire spirit world cohabiting the palace with the real world people.

Infiltrate the Ashanti [Palace](https://media.gettyimages.com/photos/king-koffees-palace-coomassie-ashanti-war-africa-1900-during-the-picture-id463953777?s=2048x2048), which has Egyptian-level stonework. It appears to be three stories, but is actually two due to high first-story ceilings.

*This architecturally advanced stone palace rises three stories and backs up to a steep rocky cliff. A small group of warriors lounges near the front entrance. Delicious cooking smells float on the breeze as smoke rises from an out building. You hear a very faint rush of water from within, and realize that a small stream issues from a portal near the main entrance steps. Cool air, much cooler than the jungle, issues from the interior.* [PIC](https://c8.alamy.com/comp/H3PJ0A/imaginary-reconstruction-of-an-egyptian-palace-in-pharaonic-times-H3PJ0A.jpg)

### Grounds

- Wives \- The King always keeps 333 wives, to be presented at need to whomever he chooses, each time then replaced immediately. They are any age, including the newly born. Beside the huts of many retainers, there are two large sets of houses, each containing 111 of these wives, many of whom he has never seen. They are rigorously hidden from sight in a circle of huts.  
- Military \- the homes of generals and military leaders  
- Barracks \- 30,000 troops (20,000 full time, 10,000 reserve) reside in the city, fully dedicated to war  
- Scribes  
- Translators  
- Cooking tents

### Outer Courts

[PIC](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DgulxUrWAAIisGl?format=jpg&name=large) [PIC](https://previews.agefotostock.com/previewimage/medibigoff/75a11e6b62d8cf95283797841f003eda/mev-12486030.jpg)

Numerous outer courts, in circles and trellised with bamboo. The picture shows the outer palazzos.

*The outer courts of the palace, which is an immense building of a variety of oblong courts and regular squares, the former with" arcades along the one side, some of round arches symmetrically turned, having a skeleton of bamboo ; the entablatures exuberantly adorned with bold fan and trellis work of Egyptian character. They have a suite of rooms over them, with small windows of wooden lattice, of intricate but regular carved work, and some have frames cased with thin gold. The sc\[uares have a large apartment on each side, open in front, with two supporting pillars, which break the view and give it all the appearance of the proscenium or front of the stage of the older Italian theatres. They are lofty and regular, and the cornices of a very bold cane work in alto relievo. A drop curtain of curiously plaited cane is suspended in front, and in each we observed chairs and stools embossed with gold, and beds of silk, with scattered regalia.*

The Map doesn't show it, but an entire additional palace exists round the center as drawn, with endless square courts and apartments.

- X Forge \- *Waves of heat distort the interior of this mud and stone building. The roar of bellows and fire can be heard. Inside, a smith and his apprentice work, very intent on their craft. There are three large vats \- one empty, one filled with iron, and a third filled with gold. The mold of a large casket nearby has seen recent use, but the resulting casket is nowhere to be seen. In front Ashanti Guard stands watch. He stares distantly at a passing concubine.*  
  - If she can be lured over, he will forget his duty and chat her up.  
- X Talking Drums \- these are bigger than a man and can transmit three miles. They are found on the roof.  
- Kitchen \- two massive cooking pits.  
- X Animal cages \- made of iron, contain: A leopard, lion, a monitor lizard, two baboons, a pangolin; above are cages of birds, mostly broadbills and colorful cuckoo shrikes. Close examination will show human bones in the carnivore cages.  
- X Prisoner Hut \- A thatched shed. Meet JT Williams, who has been trapped in a hut with the perfectly preserved heads of Ensign Wetherell and Buckle. They were all killed at the same time as MacCarthy, but he is now a gold-rimmed drinking cup. [LINK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_MacCarthy_\(British_Army_officer\)) Also in the hut is Ensign Raycliff, who served with Bolton on HMS Désirée.

Observations

- Throck \- X sees blue diamond crystal  
- Henton \- shadow realm in the palace; sees Penny  
- Gahan \-   
- Bolton \- hang out at court Greasy

3000 years of dark, tethered spirits; and a set of spirits prior to that who are normal.

*Upon entering the palace, you notice how much cooler it is than the surrounding jungle. Closer to 70 degrees than 90\. A constant breeze seems to run through the building. Most stone surfaces are brightly painted, and tapestries hang from the walls. Every door is inset with gold insignia. Noise from the jungle is somewhat lessened, but is still quite audible.*

## **Odwira Celebration**

At some point, a huge ceremony should happen.

### Entry Parade

*Great umbrellas hover over each noble, topped with an elephant, a moon, or whatever symbol and spirit they honor. Above is the fanciful standard of a chief. Boys lead the parade of a Caboceer, bearing elephants tails, fly flappers, etc.*

*Then his captains with uplifted swords. Soldiers follow, bearing the king's stool, so stained with blood that it is thought decent to cover it with red silk.*

*Then ivory horn talkers, and drummers who, grimacing, throw their white-washed drums in the air, and catch them again*

*Next is the ruler's wise man Odumata, coming round to join the procession in his state hammock lined with red taffeta, and smoking under his umbrella, at the top of which is a stuffed leopard.He is supported round the waist by a confidential slave, and one wrist is so heavily laden with gold, that it is supported on the head of a small boy.*

*Then the Caboceer himself, adorned in gold and fabric of Kente. His umbrella is sprung up and down to increase the breeze, and large grass fans are also playing. Body guards surround him, bearing knives of gold.*

*His most beautiful slave girl follows, bearing on her head a small red leather trunk, full of gold ornaments, and rich cloths*

*Following is an unfortunate victim, tortured , and two of the King's messengers clearing the way for him.*

They pass by and salute the king, waving. Some instruments [PIC](https://previews.agefotostock.com/previewimage/medibigoff/71024f659683f084456ecde140a8a3e6/mev-10221495.jpg)

### King Tutu

*The King is seated in a chair of ebony and gold, holding up his two fingers to receive the oath of the captain to the right, who, pointing to a distant country, vows to conquer it. He drinks from a cup made of a human skull.* 

GM: Roll 5 investigation to deduce it is Charles MacCarthy. His spirit hovers about the vessel, haunting, but also wrapped in chains of smokey tendrils.

\[\[ Read Bowdich's description of King Tutu, below, if you haven't already\]\]

*On the right and left of the state umbrella are the flags of Great Britain, Holland, and Denmark, and some moorish country. A group of painted figures are dancing up to the King, in the most extravagant attitudes, beating time with their long knives on the skulls of enemies stuck full of thyme (see the W Trophy Room).*

*On the right of the King sit his captains, with gold swords, their handles bearing leopard heads and snakes as large as life of the same metal.*

*Behind stands the eunuch, who superintends a group of small boys, the children of the nobility, waving elephant's tails to avert insects. These boys are kept close to the king, for education, and you imagine as leverage against their families should need arise.*

*On the King's left are his four linguists and various messengers. Otee and Quancum, are seated in conversation under an umbrella. Beside them are more musicians, playing the Sanko [PIC](https://c8.alamy.com/comp/B6022H/sanko-an-ashanti-stringed-instrument-from-west-africa-1870s-hand-colored-B6022H.jpg).*

*Surrounding them all, slaves holding gold pipes, fans of ostrich wing feathers, and girls bear silver bowls of drink and potions*

*Nearby, unfortunate criers, all deformed and wearing monkey skin caps, are seated in the front.*

### Outlanders

The European officers of the Mission are next seen, their linguists in front, their soldiers, servants, and flag behind, at the back of whom is placed the King's state hammock, under its own umbrella.

The Moors are easily distinguished by their caps, and preposterous turbans. Flanked by four, six or eight soldiers, bearing lances, and musicians with rude violins, distinct from the sanko.

### Parade

For each dignitary, heralds announce the deeds of their forefathers and ivory horn blowers murmur sinister sounds, drums rage.

Each has a number of male and female sacrifices. Pausing before the King, a knife is passed through both cheeks, marking them as an upcoming sacrifice. The expression of the victims is resigned, apathetic with no sign of emotion.

Last comes a parade of enemy skulls, accompanied by dance, for all to see the invincibility and power of the kingdom.

### Chanting

The King's deeds and titles and ancestor's deeds are chanted for about ten minutes. Then the names of honored dead are read, followed by the promulgation of six new laws.

### Noble Criminals

The Ashanti seldom prosecute nobles except at this time, so a crime might linger a whole year. Nobody knows who will be called out. It gives time for the crime to mellow, should the king wish to preserve the culprit. But also gives the King license to call out who he will. He calls three. They are literally torn to pieces by the crowd. Only those free of the corruptor are called.

### Declaration

The King declares:  
*The edges of the years have met, I take sheep and*  
*new yams and give you that you may eat.*  
*Life to me.*  
*Life to this my Ashanti people.*  
*Women who cultivate the farms, when they do so*  
*grant the food that comes forth in abundance.*  
*Do not allow the penis of the Ashanti men to die.*  
*Grant fertility and many offspring to the women.*

### Sacrifices

Each chief kills several slaves in sacrifice. First, they hack off each hand. Then they saw away the head, finally withdrawing the knife from their cheeks in finality. The crowd roars with approval as their blood runs into large brass pans. Shamans stand beside, incanting and adding herbs. Those pans are then emptied into a huge pan adorned with four golden lions, leading to a hole from which will be pulled a solid golden yam, symbol of fertility and a great harvest. However, this year instead a ritual dagger is withdrawn, symbolizing that the Ashanti must go to war.

100 slaves will be sacrificed, including MacCarthy's companion Wetherill, numerous Ga, Fente, Akya and even some Ashante who have resisted the corruptor. The heads of the sacrificed are placed upon poles all around the huge circle, and admired.

A massive fire is erected, and the gold ornaments of the King are all thrown in, to be re-formed into new and exotic decorations and shapes in the coming year.

### Oaths

*"King, the dispensation of the English shames you too much ; you must let us go to night and kill all the Fantees, and burn all the towns under the forts." They then presented themselves successively with their bands of music and retinues, and bowing before the King, received his foot upon their heads ; each then directed his sword to the King (who held up the two first fingers of his right hand) and swore by the King's head, that they would go with the army that night, and bring him the books, and the heads of all the Fantees.*

### Following Days

The king will make various travels, washings at rivers, killing of animals and the pouring their blood upon door lintels and stools.

**Palace tour until they find the golden coffin \- always in the last room explored.** In the throne room Bean says "what\!? I told them to bring it here\!"

Each palace room shows:

* Wax men  
* A portal link to Jupiter  
* Slaves: Penny, Greasy  
* A PC-centric room  
  * DNA stitching  
  * Spirit capture / becoming one with a spirit  
  * Golden rod of command  
  * So much for Gahan to steal.  
* Kwad confronting his uncle's wax simulacrum  
* Kong Image [PIC](https://ipaintingsforsale.com/UploadPic/Frank%20Frazetta/big/King%20Kong.jpg)

Ancient spirits are everywhere. The pre-Bantu spirits are friendly but cannot depart. Might help. The post-bantu spirits are forlorn, drained by the use of their essence by the Nerrossium King.

Enslavement somehow powers the NK.

### Palace \- Downstairs

NOTE: Once in the palace, anyone you see has wisps at a different angle \- towards the back of the palace.

### Throne room

See Asantehene [Osei Tutu Kwame Asiba](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ml4MhMjmapNTFYD-ifeZb_XncwotmAcRF9zSmtC7zb0/edit#bookmark=id.xmkvyfd9atqa), [PIC](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0008/9430/4309/files/kente-king_grande.jpg?v=1521479326) uncle of Kwad, but he looks dead-eyed.

- Kwad pleads with his "uncle"; tells of the mind poison of King George. Says both sides are cursed

This is a simulacrum of the king. PCs might put the wrong entity into the golden coffin, only to find the real king later.

*The thirty foot ceiling here gives a sense of grandeur. The royal stool, entirely cased in gold, is displayed under a splendid umbrella, with drums, sankos, horns and various musical instruments, also cased in gold, about the thickness of cartridge paper; large circles of gold hang by scarlet cloth from five [akrafena](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:State_Gifts_Presentation_Sword.JPG), the ceremonial swords of state, the sheaths as well as the handles of which are also gold cased; hatchets of the same are intermixed with them; the breasts of the Ocrahs \[soul-washers\], and various attendants, are adorned with large stars, stools, crescents, and gossamer wings of solid gold.*

### Central Courtyard

[PIC](https://imgc.artprintimages.com/img/print/ancient-egyptian-palace-interior-1888_u-l-ptfq0m0.jpg?h=550&p=0&w=550) contains fruit trees, nut trees, benches, and a parrot who might raise an alarm.

- Co-resident spirit realm   
- Allows you to move through the gate but without effect upon the physical world. Distance from the gate makes everything fuzzy.  
- I think that Hinton with his focus on seeing the unseen should strongly well he should see the puppet like nature of the corruptor manipulating people and avatars. He should see the Smoky oily strands interweaving the Ashanti population.

### Concubine's quarters

contains 33 women, 50% chance asleep, six slaves, and a set of four African Golden Cats which are magnificent and couldn't care less that you exist unless you startle them. One woman [PIC](https://i.etsystatic.com/17752892/r/il/cb1ed1/1926025432/il_794xN.1926025432_9e80.jpg), apparently of highest status, is a Wax Simulacrum. She wears golden Aggrey beads. [PIC](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/eb/aa/6f/ebaa6fc73caec09d9d515231b1ea8fb0.jpg)

- **Penny** is in the harem [PIC](https://i.etsystatic.com/17978678/r/il/5d61f1/3010780749/il_794xN.3010780749_s6hs.jpg), drugged, and she fawns over Throckmorton calling him Morty. Dark wisps lick at her feet.

### Dining area

A meal consisting of a roasted large **human thighs** awaits. The eaters revel in showing they can drink the most palm wine, indulging the luxury of spilling much of it through their beards. Women may not attend.

- Can they meet the Caboceer here?

### Armory

Wax men

- 12 damage to penetrate with your hand to grab its heart crystal  
- 8 damage to lop off a limb  
- 18 to cut it in half  
- Unusual spears and curved daggers with the symbol of the Bantu.  
- Etched with Ditema Tsa Dinoko [PIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ditema_tsa_Dinoko), [PIC](https://www.omniglot.com/images/langsamples/smp_ditema.gif), [PIC](https://www.omniglot.com/images/langsamples/smp_ditema.gif)

### Library

*The walls of this tall room seem to block all sound. Slots high in the wall, craftily angled, allow sun/moon beams to light the chamber. Shelves hold books and scrolls from many cultures. In a glass case rests a glittering sword. Seven stands display holy books: a Christian Bible, a Jewish Talmud, the Hindu Vedas, an Islamic Quran, the Jainist Agamas, and two more you do not recognize. At one end of the library is a raised platform with a piano, two violins, and an incongruously large brass tuba. A large object is covered by a sheet.*

- The sword is **Mponponson**, called "Responsibility"  
- The unknown religious books are the   
  - Tao te Jing  
  - Zoroastrian Avesta  
  - *Christian Bible*  
  - *a Jewish Talmud and Kabballah*  
  - *the Hindu Vedas*  
  - *an Islamic Quran*  
  - *the Jainist Agamas*  
- Other important books here are Confucious' Analects, a set of scrolls composing the Egyptian Book of the Dead, and the British Domesday Book.   
- **Voodoo doll** of Constance \- things that happen to it happen to her, but she doesn't feel them. She just suffers the wound.  
- **Sarcophagus** lid is here, propped up and covered with symbols.  
- **Tablets** stolen from   
- Bolton take the metal parrot

### Midden

where the king and harem defecate. Slaves transport it out the concealed passage. **Roll 5** to find the secret passages.

## **Palace \- Upstairs**

- Upstairs are all the bedrooms; the east side is royalty and concubines. The west side is visitors, the chief of staff, head scribe, guest quarters for the general of the army, and guest quarters for the forgemaster.
