# Scenario: Ward of Subjugation

## **Ancestor Tomb**

Behind the waterfall there is a narrow natural stone passage leading to a room with two doors of gold. In that room is a pool one must cross containing crocodiles that are kept hungry \- but distracting them with food works.

### Ancestor Shrine Sanctum

With a waterfall on one side falling over massive stone doors. This requires:  
\[\[ 8 \]\] for anything to succeed

- **The king** meditates here, purifying himself in the blood of the sacrifices. **(from the brass pans of Odwira)**  
  - **King**: Anticipates everything (intention shield)  
  - **Skull**: Bad luck (chaos resistance) and possession (liberated mind)  
  - **Blood**: He splashes all with blood, which has a contact hallucinogen in it.  (sensorium control)  
  - **Gelada**: physical, benefit from anticipation; 4 vs Constance  
  - **Kwad** \- gets taken over  
  - He puts on a gelada black skull [PIC](https://i.imgur.com/s9JgG3U.jpeg) on the bones of MacCarthy, who animates  
  - He wields the blood spattered **Bantu Dagger of War**   
  - He anticipates anything anybody does, and shares this with his Gelada guardians  
  - Perhaps the real king who you can't afford to kill is not susceptible to chloroform or only mildly so. Perhaps there's a complication to getting him back to the coffin.  
- The three other troublemakers are here, tied, ready to be sacrificed, with knives through their cheeks: **Josephus**, **Agarn**, and **Dinky Derrick**  
- Gelada lounge here. They wear necklaces with those orange gems from the mine (and from the black relic skull)

### Treasury

with a rolling stone entry door. See treasure below.

- Golden leopard with rubies \- ([pic](https://dma.org/sites/default/files/styles/slideshow_medium/public/slideshow_images/Sword%20ornament%20in%20the%20form%20of%20a%20lion_2010.2.McD_.jpg?itok=YiLByAG-)) \- Sympathy with its spirit (Gahn?) gives you leopard capabilities. Gain an asset in silent movement, hearing, leaping, climbing, and initiative  
- Pair of Gold Rings \- ([pic](https://i.imgur.com/HLBgK8I.jpg)) Wear these rings and they enable communication between the bearers in times of stress. And you get to know the general status of the other.  
- Gold Spider \- ([pic](https://i1.wp.com/blog.dma.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/sword-ornament-in-the-form-of-a-spider_2014-26-1.jpg?resize=475%2C374&ssl=1)) \- fill it with blue vitriol and it moves at your command. However, it is evil so ultimately it will foil your intent.  
- Ring of Anansi \- ([pic](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcSOz494fqe5Qae3iC1339DtTch5RkzCvue7FQ&usqp=CAU)) This golden ring, crudely made to have eight legs, gives the wearer advantage attempting to decipher any story or symbols in any language. Also the ability to tell spellbinding stories.  
- Gold Shield \- ([pic](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/25/Afrikaabteilung_in_Ethnological_Museum_Berlin_81.JPG/1280px-Afrikaabteilung_in_Ethnological_Museum_Berlin_81.JPG)) Cleanse an area of bad luck (gives a second roll)  
- Ivory Comb \- ([pic](https://i.pinimg.com/564x/58/51/22/585122bdee91818dc21a0527980771f3.jpg))   
- 11 Akan Bronze Figurines \- ([pic](https://assets.catawiki.nl/assets/2016/5/14/4/e/0/4e0dfd4c-19ea-11e6-852b-9458b08fe005.jpg))     
- Ivory Fertility Figure \- ([pic](https://media.sandhills.com/img.axd?id=4379573101&wid=&p=&ext=&w=0&h=0&t=&lp=&c=True&wt=False&sz=Max&rt=0&checksum=A9aOIkEubLK6hWgHqDB6ECJqCwa%2B82vX))  
- Bronze Jar and Lid \- ([pic](https://assets.xupes.com/Images/Product/7557/SingleImages/Main/Superb-Antique-Ashanti-Kuduo-Bronze-Figural-Lidded-Jar-1920th-C.jpg))  
- Bronze war horn goldweight [PIC](http://www.vam.ac.uk/__data/assets/image/0003/223788/2007BL9788_goldweight_ghana_custom_290x429_6362034859.jpg)

### L to Torture Chamber

Two are here

* A Kabbalah is open on a stand.  
* **Afia** is here. A curved dagger is passed through her cheeks. She tells of resisting work  
* **Ook** \- The important thing about him is that he is an austra. He has been captured, crushed by a skin monster, and made unable to slay himself. So he should be the one that heroically becomes a problem, and cannot be fully subjugated.  
* **MacCarthy \-** The headless remains of slump in manacles here. His head has been replaced with the gold lined skull

### R to Trophy room

- The heads of a hundred enemy kings, nobles, and caboceers conquered in war, each with a twig of thyme in their eyes to keep them from troubling the king. These are paraded during the Yam Festival.  
- Stored here: a reagents room with lead and sulpur etc.  
- Records: **Only the mightiest king that strides the Earth is suitable to become the eighth ward**

### Runed Gate

- Henton to use archaeology to interpret the symbology.  
- Throckmorton to use sulphur to blunt the senses of the watcher spirits  
- Gahan to disable the spear traps at the entrance  
- **Waterfall** deludes the mind like a drug  
- By the time the PCs get into the Ashantee crypt, they have been exposed to numerous drugs that cloud the mind. Anything they see could be a **hallucination**.  
- Requires sacrifice of a sentient to pass the doors. Once and then those involved have access. Baboons don't count.

There should be a clearly archaeological puzzle to the doors. They should look much older than the current civilization. There's some kind of a hint about the Bantu civilization to a trained archaeologist. I think maybe I should give the players some kind of archaeological puzzle maybe something translate.

* Room of experimental horrors  
  * Wax men  
  * Skin monsters

### Corridor

* Muddy water  
* rushing river past thimble-sized gold inclusions, explaining the gold dust sifted from the rivers.  
* Crocodiles  
* See the piglets [PIC](https://preview.redd.it/7046l542fbs71.jpg?width=640&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=80bd72048bc0758f9b9ac3022c0296e9c11fd494)

### Crossing Pit

* A lever on the far side lowers a bridge. The walls are extremely slick. The metal bird is   
* [PIC](https://mir-s3-cdn-cf.behance.net/project_modules/1400/9c186643988639.5804a31a5cbe3.jpg), [PIC](https://mir-s3-cdn-cf.behance.net/project_modules/1400/9c186643988639.5804a31a5cbe3.jpg)

Up on the cliffside at the entrance. Have seen the step pyramid 1/4 mile away.

Soap bubble whirlwind will rise from there up to the anti-gravity soap bubble edge.

### Huge Cavern

* Jungle filled enormous trees  
* 2x Cryptid jungle encounters  
* Gelada, but you can evade them. All have been blinded and their nodded removed.  
- Portal to Jupiter's 2nd Ward storm  
  - Shut the portal  
  - Inky tendrils through the portal lead to the Nerrosium king (who thence leads to all the Ashante)  
  -   
- Each character acquires an invisible Rider something that wrapped on the back of the neck wrapped around their shoulders or their neck, and only at a certain moment are these things noticeable undetectable. And they all suddenly realize they have them. I think whenever you oppose something these things wrap around your neck and you feel like you're wheezing but you never quite notice and truly think about what it is

### Top-Half Zero grav Cavern Room

* Cavern: [PIC](https://cdna.artstation.com/p/assets/images/images/000/034/952/4k/0_JTCE_raph.jpg?1400214348)  
* Low gravity  
* **Shark birds** glide about here  
* **Bodies** of the tribe of women warriors, and Ga members of the expedition float here, tied together by nooses around their necks  
* **Skins** are being extracted by the shark birds, who vibrate on them  
* Tubby, Terence, Beard, Davey C, Ruby tend them, floating from body to body feeding and collecting feces  
* Ruins float about in the cavern  
* King Kong moment [PIC](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-VmbNGd3K9zQ/UPuOT2N4WoI/AAAAAAAAb7U/6u0CZpl-wEM/s1600/Image+\(13\).jpg)

### Pyramid

* Top is formed with a quicksilver ring, to pull in souls, to a central dodecahedron  
* Room piled high with hacked off hands  
* Entrance guarded by 2x Wooden Scaled Men  
  * Regular weapons just knock off scales  
  * You must disable them somehow \- tossing them off the pyramid works  
  * Weapons do 8 points of damage, and always stick right through a person coming out the other side

# Nerossium King (Black Opal Osei)

[DETAILS](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ml4MhMjmapNTFYD-ifeZb_XncwotmAcRF9zSmtC7zb0/edit#bookmark=id.q7k4f6yh3n9i), [PIC2](https://i.imgur.com/bNpEV5a.jpeg)  
Ultimately, in the last room, you must confront the Nerossium King. He sits on a throne of Nitre (saltpeter aka sodium nitrate) crystals [PIC](https://media.crystalls.info/w/uploads/media/S.popov.sodium.nitrate.2.jpg) amidst a pool of quicksilver. He is chained in place using chains of sulfurous gold.

The Nerossium King is the **ward of subjugation**.  
All characters will be instantly subjugated and put to work tending the skin monster farm.

### Center Floor

*This room is faced entirely in black marble, with woven patterns of crystal or diamond embedded in the walls. Shapes and figures are depicted here: a child, head pressed into the ground by a boot heel, men and women chained to a huge grinding wheel in a savannah, toiling under a hot Egyptian sun, a woman knocked to the ground by an angry master holding a whip, men being being fed to lions in ancient Rome, men tethered to each other upon the blistering hot deck of a pitching sailing ship.*

*A gigantic brass dodecahedron sits, suspended by ropes, in the midst of the room. The edges of the soap-bubble gravity membrane gently curve into the center, ending at a small point of light. Each side is a perfect circle, and yet it has twelve sides.*

- UP: steps  
- Down: a door with a place for a strange shape.  
- **Bean** will brief the party. They must somehow confront the ward of subjugation. He has trained for seventeen years to face it. Using his knowledge of magic he will guard them against it while they act.

### Elevated Platform (Top Floor)

*This room is also faced entirely in black marble, with woven patterns of diamond. The murals on one side here show men being hunted through jungle, a chieftain takes coins and hands over children and the elderly. On the other side the murals resemble an auction black. On all sides men, women and children kneel in bondage, ready to be sold to the highest bidder.*

*On one side, an open entryway lets into the air of the Jungle.*

*The occasional Shark Bird [PIC](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/8a/3b/e0/8a3be083f4c6976df718e080a81d7b23.jpg) flies into the room, circling and then entering small holes in the wall.*

*Five living men kneel around the center hole, naked except for shabby loinclothes,  Each is covered whitely with some kind of strange dusty substance. Curved black daggers hang from their loin clothes. Each wears a mask [PIC](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/8f/1c/6a/8f1c6a51fd9f4de68f1faa7fdf7c848b.jpg), and at their waist hang little balls of fetish, containing a black, inky powder.* 

*They kneel here as if in homage to the hole in the center of the platform. They are skinny, emaciated, and their backs bear the scars of the whip. They chant in the Bantu language, each beating a small drum.*

- **Henton**: The souls of the Zayans, bit by bit, are being drawn down through the hole in the roof of the pyramid. Not the women warriors... the Zayans released from the huge pan in the ruins.  
- *Subjugated Acolytes*  
  - Each wears a bracelet which fits the door down.  
  - If they hit you with the powder of the fetish, you begin to suffer bad luck.  
- After battle, **Kong** reaches in the hole in the roof and grabs Constance, and also sexy Bolton

### Lower Chamber

*This room is built more like a pavilion than a chamber. Five stout, stone columns stand at the edges, holding up the roof. Between one pair of columns is a flat picture depicting a roiling storm of pale reds, hazy blues and dim grays. The colors in the picture move at a furious pace.* 

*In front of each column is a pool, with a raised lip. As you watch, out of one pool, a rumpled pile of human skin drags wetly upwards and across the picture threshold. As it crosses the membrane it seems to flatten, then moves away into the storm.*

*A ring of gold circles the room, just above the height of the picture. Hundreds of Shark Birds perch upon the ring, occasionally alighting beside a pool and drinking from the substance within.*

*In the center of the room, upon a throne of crystalline cubes, resides a large skeleton. Every bone is a deep black, flecked like black opal [PIC](https://i0.wp.com/blacklightningopals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/B300I1.jpg?fit=3707%2C3707&ssl=1). Upon the skeleton face is an African mask \[roll DC4 to know Bantu warrior\]. Strange characters are etched within the throne, in ancient Bantu. Above, a hole completely covered in quicksilver opens narrowly, filled with the reflective substance.*

*The room is utterly still. The shark birds are silent. The sludge in the pools unmoving,*

\[\[ While everyone is present, they are silently subjugated. Each goes blank in the eyes, until all are subjugated. \]\]

- Bean is then forced to kill himself (but Henton can still communicate with him)

**\[\[ All might be killed, and the Zayan spirit will depart instead \]\]**  
**\[\[ TO DO:** 

- **Anyone who bought Sensorium Control can trade it in for either Reality Discipline, or Body Autonomy**  
- **Bolton should get a heavy dose of Chaos Resistance due to his sense of what is right and the mission of the Empire he resists misfortune.**  
- **Henton: May buy Spirit Reading, the ability to see what a person's spirit indicates before they act. Gives bonus to defense.**

**\]\]**

**Remember:**

- **Gahan will never be attacked, nor be subject to bad luck. He can not be seen.**  
- **Describe Nerossium King more. The opal bones, the feather necklace, mask, opal, and whip. The throne of salt crystals (roll chemistry).**  
- **Henton's spirits can defend**  
- **Moira, tier 6, can**  
  - **Ward a spirit away**  
  - **Misdirect any mortal, even the subjugated, if she can talk.**  
  - **Cause fortunate accidents for friends. She can focus on one PC at a time.**  
  - **Cause unfortunate accidents for opponents.**  
  - **Speak truths about what is about to happen to avoid disaster, but incur bad luck upon herself.**

Consta 14m, 18s, 4i  
Gahan 3m, 31s, 9i  
Throck 2m, 6s, 3i	\- bad luck, skin monster draped over him, but not engulfing him  
Bolton 12m, 1s, 16i	\- bad luck  
Henton 13m, 8s, 17i	  
Moira \- is alive and can give comfort  
Trouble Makers \- Bean can protect seven \- C, G, T, B, H, M, \+1 trouble maker  
Bean \- is dead, guarding everyone from subjugation by the Nerossium King.

- His seven interwoven, guarding spirits will be lost one per turn, until only he remains  
- Henton may choose to connect with him, or not

Arrivals: Afia, Mr. Monk, Kwad

IMPORTANT: Can Henton take the throne and accept all of the Zayan (and other) spirits

**GATE**  
Skin monsters pass into the gate, which shows furious whipping winds on the far side.

- Entering causes you to become 2.4x as heavy as you are on Earth. This happens to whatever parts of you are beyond the gate, so you have plenty of time to feel the parts of your body getting heavier as you enter  
- The whipping storm begins to flay the skin from your body, and causes you to begin to cook (like moving at 300 MPH standing on an airplane wing). 2 might per round to crawl. 2 **Phys** per round of flaying damage, and **2 Speed** pressure damage, and **1 Int** heat damage.  
- 

**Avatar of Subjugation, the 5th ward**.  
Health 100	**\-10**  
Tier 7		(or 9 without Intention Shield)  
TIER 5/7 NOW; diff 3 vs skin  
Armor 4	(opal stone bones)  
The armor reduces as you win the mental battle, or use reagents. It must be destroyed both mentally and physically, and bones ground to dust.

* OnHit:  
  * Each time he is hit, **1-2 slivers of black bone** shard fragments from him, automatically attacking some enemy in the room. Each hit yields a weakness to subjugation.  
  * All regular blades shatter. Titanium does not, and the black daggers don't (but misses by them may become hits on companions)  
* X Wax eyes \- **See material world**; remove to \-1 tier him  
* X Feather Necklace: **Shark Bird** command; scour or Subjugate Minds  
* X Mask Attack: **Skin Monster** command and give Intention Shield  
* Opal Attack: **Spirits** Command enslaved spirits; to curse, blind, cause bad luck, etc.  
* Whip Attack: **Subjugate**: Tier 7, does 1m, 1s, 1i and you must obey one command (but not to kill friends). Roll *Liberated Mind 5* to resist.  
* Grasp \- if you get close this will subjugate except on 20

Phases  
Each round the King makes a whip attack.

1. NK searches for Gahan; lights off  
2. Skin Monsters creep from the vats, and more each round.  
   1. Trouble makers must defend, will get crushed as used as vehicles.  
   2. They will belch Verdigris, giving disadvantage against mind attacks to anyone covered  
3. Bad luck curses from dark spirits controlled by the Bantu King, vs *Chaos Resistance 5*  
   1. These can blind, cause tripping and misdirected attacks, misread intentions, dropped weapons  
   2. Each is a dark spirit, visible to and defendable by Henton.  
   3. Curses are also resistable with stolid character, which Bolton has.   
4. \<\< Lucius & Afia arrive, with Mr. Mump and Kwad. The king was freed. A mob comes. \>\>  
5. Arsenic eruption \- *Body Autonomy 5*  
   1. From out of the walls spring arsenic crystals [PIC](https://www.newtondesk.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Yellow-arsenic-in-orphiment-mineral.png). These cause all physical and speed actions to cost \+1 additional point due to lung trouble.   
6. \<\< hear smashing upstairs from giant ape \>\>  
7. Shark birds overcome minds. Roll *Liberated Mind 5* to avoid.  
   1. Constance especially is overwhelmed and made to attack her companions.  
8. Shark bird swarm. 2p per round, halved if you speed dodge with DC 5\. Can't penetrate armor. They chomp with their shark teeth, and bring bad luck to all in the room while swarming. Rolling 1-6 brings a mishap

**Gahan's turn \-** 

* **Subjugated:** Gahan \[c\], Henton \[c\], Moira, Afia. Henton and Lucius are still to be controlled during their turns. \[c\] means you've already had your required turn of being controlled.  
* **Gahan** \- manacled, 1 black shard, Sm 0/3 up him  
* **Throckmorton \-** just made the ape collapse the ceiling; 0/3 SM  
* **Constance** \- blew Bolton's hand off, the one that had the ring.  
* **Henton** \- 0/3 SM  
* **Moira** just dove for the ring. She will throw it to Throckmorton, who will receive a direct channel to Saint Benedict's vitality.  
* **Bolton** has just blown the Warhorn, rallying all who might help (not many)  
  * 1x TMs are 1/3 SM  
  * BB both manacles  
  * Hand bounced through the swirling window  
* **Arsenic** covers the floor, causing all actions to require one additional   
* **Shark birds** are unconscious on the floor from Moira, but **rousing** now that she is distracted.  
* King has stood, surrounded by skin monsters

**\[\[ Ape is angry at Throckmorton now, will grab him. But that contact gives him an asset to connect \]\]**

9. **Whip attacks**, especially on Constance and Henton.  
10. Enslaved crew mates appear. They will fight to disable and subjugate, but weakly like a slave with no hope might, Tier 2\.  
    1. Beard  
    2. Greasy the cook  
    3. Davey Coxhammer  
    4. Ruby the Carpenter  
    5. Ralph "Tubby" Steward  
11. One of the oil lamps in the room is made to touch oil in a small trough in the wall. This signals to slay the sky prisoners. Their spirits rush into the gravity funnel. \<\<Who takes the throne?\>\>  
12. Subjugated Spirits will erupt from the murals on the walls.  
13. Kong smash: Ceiling will collapse, covering the floor in rubble 3' deep.  
    1. The salt throne is protected by a bubble of nullified gravity.  
    2. The rubble is harms everyone, but is then sucked out the gate, along with anything in the room. **At least one player should get sucked out, and glimpse the Crystal City, enormous blue diamond shapes (like the Golem powering crystals), looming creatures riding the storm, a swarm of Skin Monsters, many of which look ragged and flayed, and machine-like entities scaling the crystalline towers.**  
    3. Kong will grab Constance and Bolton, unless influenced.

Character Roles

* **Afia** If we do this right many will die along the way including afia and oh okay.  
* **Constance** enters the room and immediately becomes possessed. Shark birds are everywhere. Her bullets have limited effect. Every blade will do damage then shatter. Titanium shatters not.  
* **Lucius** should protect Constance, and shield compatriots or remove their curses. He can turn back time to undo catastrophic moments. He also must remove possession from Constance\!  
* **Gahan** goes unnoticed by the corrupted, and BAD LUCK NEVER AFFECTS HIM. He can travel into the dreams of others? This is why he is being bred. His savant nature sees the five Kabala stones supporting the NK.  
* **Bolton's** commands aid all, and his Troublemakers defend the crypt from skin monsters. He must offset the deeply demoralizing impacts of the NK's influence.  
* **Henton's** spirit sight helps him see who the NK is attacking next, and NK's spirit-driven curses. Henton's spirits can discover the weaknesses in metaphysical opponents, that is, "open doors" to attack and defend against incoming spirit assaults (to black nd, or deceive, or possess)  
* **Throckmorton** Can he stitch DNA to alter his companions for the battle? Perhaps removing certain Corruptor-induced wards? Turns away poisoning with naturalism, and brews things that affect golems/Waxen Warriors (beyond fire). He can also disable large groups of normals with naturalism, grant party members the characteristics of natural creatures briefly (ant strength, komodo hide, owls ears)

**Dead bodies choke the city. 30,000 of them. 8,000 were in the corridor returning to the surface.**

* **Rescued crew members must still be purged, some of them**  
* **Moira's leg is shattered.**  
* **Each trouble maker has a manacle; bully buster has both hands manacled**

## **After Defeat**

Exit

* Journeying down the hall, you see dead bodies in their hundreds  
* Everyone in the palace will be found dead, producing a huge mass of free spirits for the corruptor.  
* Same with the city

Plot

* **Mump** emerges from the gold coffin. It looked empty, but this is his power  
* **Task** Mump says must find any living babies or toddlers asap.  
* **Henton** \- sees spirits being pulled towards the collapsed pyramid room  
* **Palace Steps** \- all crew members are struck unconscious. PCs must save  
* **Bad Luck** \- Progressing, ever-building bad luck. See "Night Children" below.  
* **Melted puddles** of wax, with footsteps in them, leading into the treasure room  
* **Night Children**: Deep black children with no eyes run around, hard to see in the dark. With eye sockets but no eyes. Ear holes but no ears. A mouth but no tongue.  
* **Crew** \- Tubby, Terence, Beard, Davey C, Ruby

Records Room (below the library)

* Uniforms of enemies  
* Book: **Chronicles of the Bantu empire**, in meticulous detail.  
  * Mwari, the first emperor  
  * The Bantu peoples also spread their stateless societies. Stateless societies lacked a centralized hierarchy of government officials and a bureaucracy and instead were led by family groups that balanced the ruling power among them and made decisions together for the good of the whole society.  
* Book: **Plague Apocrypha**  
  * The plague of 1347 was due to revelations about the Corruptor, which he eliminated. Bahmani Sultanate  
  * The 1818 plague is the same. A network of Sufi and hindu mystics delved too deep, and shared too much.  
* Book: **Blank**  
  *   
* Book: **Codes of the Living Man**  
* Leather rubbing oil. When applied to the blank book these words surface: "Those who rule the mightiest empires rightly believe themselves gods, indifferent to the plight of all their fellow men".  
  * This triggers a forward memory in Lucius:  
  * Lucius has been in the future: The British empire will be the largest empire in history and, for over a century, the foremost global power. In 100 years the Empire will hold sway over 412 million people, 25 per cent of the world population. 99% of them were subjugated by 1%. Only defeating Mwari can avert that future.

By 1913 the British Empire held sway over 412 million people, 23 per cent of the world population at the time, and by 1920 it covered 35,500,000 km2 (13,700,000 sq mi), 24 percent of the Earth's total land area.Laboratory (below the gold forge)

* Mwari CLX escaped and came here to try to heal in a bacta tank  
* Dna metaphors with literal needle and thread  
* Zayan technology leg braces

Palace & Grounds

* **Penny** is swooning in the harem  
* It becomes clear that the palace is coplanar with the ancient Bantu king's palace. It was he that positioned himself as a god, opening the door to become the fifth ward. His name was Mwari.  
* **Parrot**: Five Toe Pete or one of the three troublemakers who were with our crew at the Zayan city should be moan the loss of the metal parrot  
* **Diplomats**: Find the diplomats slaughtered.

Sun streams in shafts from small holes above. Numerous forest tree roots seek from the ceiling into the water, creating perfectly round root bundles. The water is so still, pure and clear blue that disturbing it feels like a violation. Across the chamber is a carved stone tomb of surpassing workmanship, laced with gold and ivory.*

- All feel compelled to leap or climb between islands.  
- Entering the water causes roots to spring from the ceiling, wrap around the person, and they begin to turn to calcium unless pulled free within 60 seconds.  
- On a central island is a stone monument inset with gold. Tree roots lace into it from above.

Objective: Extract the black relic from the [Black Opal King](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ml4MhMjmapNTFYD-ifeZb_XncwotmAcRF9zSmtC7zb0/edit#bookmark=id.q7k4f6yh3n9i) staked under water and smash it. When you do, half of all the members of the king's household (anyone not protected) simply drop dead. You will see the bodies on your way out. Any remaining wax people melt.

- Return to find Twum Ampofo murdered  
  - Afia is now regent  
  - She says he was never cut out for rulership anyway, and takes the Ofori stool immediately.

## **Completion**

Return to the coast.

* Learn that Afia's uncle died, and she is now Asantehene of the Akyem.  
* While waiting to set sail, meet Maitland.

Captain [Frederick Maitland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederick_Lewis_Maitland_\(Royal_Navy_officer\)) of [HMS *Bellerophon*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMS_Bellerophon_\(1786\)) testifies that "it was not Napoleon" that surrendered to him on 15 July, 1815\. Yes, it appeared to be. No, he never mentioned Josephine's death. We had dinner aboard ship. He was quiet. But his eyes had no soul. I shall always recall those dead, dead eyes.

# People

### King Tutu

The king's short story is that he is a malignant narcissist similar to Ron Hubbard, Sun Myung Moon, Idi Amin, etc. Never wrong. Always the most important.

**The King** *appeared to be about thirty-eight years of age, inclined to corpulence, and of a benevolent countenance ; he wore a fillet of aggry beads round his temples, a necklace of gold cock- spur shells strung by their largest ends, and over his right shoulder a red silk cord, suspending three saphies cased in gold ; his bracelets were the richest mixtures of beads and gold, and his fingers covered with rings ; his cloth was of a dark green silk ; a pointed diadem was elegantly painted in white on his forehead ; also a pattern resembling an epaulette on each shoulder, and an ornament like a full blown rose, one leaf rising above another until it covered his whole breast ; his knee-bands were of aggr}-^ beads, and his ancle strings of gold ornaments of the most delicate M'ork- manship, small drums, sankos, stools, swords, guns, and birds, clustered together ; his sandals, of a soft white leather, were em- bossed across the instep band with small gold and silver cases of saphies ; he was seated in a low chair, richly ornamented with gold ; he wore a pair of gold castanets on his finger and thumb, which he clapped to enforce silence. The belts of the guards behind his chair, were cased in gold, and covered with small jaw bones of the same metal ; the elephants tails, waving like a small cloud before him, were spangled with gold, and large plumes of feathers were flourished amid them. His eunuch presided over these attendants, wearing only one massy piece of gold about his neck : the royal stool, entirely cased in gold, was displayed under a splendid umbrella, with drums, sankos, horns, and various mu- sical instruments, cased in gold, about the thickness of cartridge paper : large circles of gold hung by scarlet cloth from the swords of state, the sheaths as well as the handles of which were also cased ; hatchets of the same were intermixed with them : the breasts of the Ocrahs, and various attendants, were adorned with large stars, stools, crescents, and gossamer wings of solid gold.*  
**Apokoo** \- the royal treasurer; ostentatious display of his service ; the blow pan, boxes, scales and weights, were of solid gold; Also an elderly general.  
**Linguists** \- Four men, each with a gold cane of office; Quashie, the Accra Unguist,  
Akobo \- Executioner. The executioner, a man of an immense size, wore a massy gold hatchet on his breast ; and the execution stool was held before him, clotted in blood, and partly covered with a cawl of fat.  
**Odumata** \- one of the four aristocrats ; he begged us to drink palm wine with him, and ordered a large jar of it to be sent to our servants. He told us he was the first captain who fought with the English at Annamaboe

HORROR PUZZLES

HORROR PUZZLE 1

A child with no mouth but a tiny toothless hole and skeletal stomach wails, scratching you with claws trying to eat. There is a table of food, which if stick in the hole so it chokes and seizures. You can't feed it.

All damage delays it, giving time for discussion and tension, but when it mives again, or returns, seeming to make it hungrier, but never kills it.

1\. It will try to claw off flesh, smashing whatever bloody bits into the mouth hole.

2\. It will paralize you, then stab you with a fork and try to carve you for food. 

3\. it will puncture with a spike and seek to suck blood.

The key is to:  
\* give it (your own) blood by injection or mouth-hole  
\* chew the food then offer it (best)  
\* Let it suck your blood

If it gets blood, from time to time its spectral form can be glimpsed feeding on the person, like a leech, causing \-1 hinder on all tasks, and reducing might by 6 (regained after a sunrise).

PUZZLE 2

One of the PCs grows to 7' tall. The others shrink to 4'. The Big is seen to kill a child by picking it up and dashing its head to the floor. This repeats, with slight variation, until someone substitutes themselves for the child. Killing the Big works but blood fills the chamber, from the ceiling down, a bit more each time and soon all will drown.

PUZZLE 3

Figures in paintings emerge, but as black beasts with faces painted as those in the paintings.

They are stealing bits if the PCs, for example "pulling off an ear or eye" which then appear in the paintings.

They are not attacking, but rather sapping one's Int pool. 

One must dissolve them with water or blood or some liquid. One may paint enemies (including in blood) who can oppose thems, or re-paint the wall paintings to be harmless.
