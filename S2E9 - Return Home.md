# Scenario: Return Home

Illuminati meeting:

* Give stipend  
* Introduce illuminati  
* 

**Money**  
6 pcs \+ 6 trouble makers \+ 6 catatonics \= 18  
30 lbs carried by each  
\= 18 \* 30 \= 540 lbs  
\- 100 lbs of mica tablets and artifacts  
\- 50 lbs of rare books  
\= 390 lbs of gold

1 oz of gold \= £3.17.10, or £4.2 sterling per "fine ounce", assumed to be a troy ounce  
14.5 troy ounces in 1 avoirdupois pound  
390 \* 14.5 \* 4.2 \= £23,751 pounds sterling  
£1 in 1818 is £91 today, and £1 GBP today equals 1.34 USD  
£23,751 \* 91 \* 1.34 \= $2.9M USD

By comparison, in the US, it was $19 per troy ounce, so 390\*14.5\*19=$107,445 in 1818 dollars  
The dollar is now worth 22x more, so 107445\*22=$2.36M

Conversion from £1 in 1818 to today's dollars is 121x

Each person   
WRONG: 82,000 pounds sterling in gold ($9M)  
CORRECT: Reward of 500/yr stipend ($60,000)

9 shares were granted  
1 for 1 captain  
1 for 10 officers  
1 for 20 crew  
6 for players

WHAT DID THEY DO WITH THE BABIES?

- Guillaume and Theo born to Gahan's French girls, Marie Noelle and Jacinthe  
- Daphne and Theresa from Africa  
- Under uncle Ewan's care

What do they do with the catatonic crew members?

- Tubby, Terence, Beard, Davey (now Danielle) Coxhammer, Ruby, Penny  
- Augusta  
- A maid and a nurse and a butler

"I hereby solemnly swear and agree, upon my honor and all that I hold sacred, not to reveal, nor by mission of action cause to be revealed, the true purpose and result of our mission to any person, living or dead."

# Prelude to the Meeting

Before meeting the Enlightened

* **Gahan** feels the same kinship with Augusta's baby girl (see below). The baby was kept isolated on the ship, and he never had occasion to touch her, which is how he notices this feeling.  
* **Throckmorton** meets his next door neighbor Martha, who knows Penny; is followed home by a [poodle](https://dogtime.com/assets/uploads/2020/09/pudelpointer-dog-breed-pictures-cover.jpg) lost on the street. He learns Penny has a brother.  
* **Bolton** is paid a call by Capitán Carmen Lejárraga (his only female crush), who has just returned from Java and Borneo. She   
* **Augusta's** baby daughter Alexandrina Victoria; 24 May 1819 – 22 January 1901  Princess Charlotte of Wales, was the only legitimate grandchild of George III. Her death in 1817 (actually she got on the Mercy's Light) precipitated a succession crisis that brought pressure on the Duke of Kent and his unmarried brothers to marry and have children. She was baptised Alexandrina after one of her godparents, Tsar Alexander I of Russia, and Victoria. She is fifth in line of succession, after George IV's four brothers.

### Lady Margaret

Sends a missive to Constance with "Lux lucet in tenebris" (the Waldensian motto). This unlocks memories in Constance's mind. First, of the Waldensian symbol [PIC](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b1/Waldenser-Wappen.jpg) etched into the headboard of the little bed she slept on for many years.

Second, that Lady M is, in fact, a Waldensian, and that it was the kindly Waldensians who took Constance off the street and housed her and the other children.

### The False Meeting

Bolton gets a message, "Gather your compatriots. Let us celebrate your grand adventure, compliments of the British Museum." The address is in Soho, the former residence of the Bourbon princes in exile.

Jean Soult has taken over Louis XVIII's former quarters, and improperly billing to the french regime. Helped by spies he placed on the docks, has identified the Regle Choisie, and learned the identity of Bolton. He captures Bolton and whomever he brings.

But his wife Claire says their daughter is only alive because of Throckmorton.

### Order of the Garter

The order was established to commemorate an incident in which Edward was dancing when one of his partner’s blue garters dropped to the floor. As bystanders snickered, Edward gallantly picked up the garter and put it on his own leg, admonishing the courtiers in French with the phrase that remains the order’s motto, “Honi soit qui mal y pense” (“Shame to him who thinks evil of it,” popularly rendered as “Evil to him who evil thinks”). The king inaugurated the Order of the Garter with a great feast and joust. The lady was Joan, "Fair Maid of Kent"... note that this is the same Kent that Victoria's mom comes from.

# Flavor

Characters

- **Zadkiel Morrison** moves in with Quintus, and starts wearing a turban. His Almanac is coming along nicely.  
- **Captain Hervey** no sooner arrives in London than he vanishes without a trace.  
- £1,000,000 has just been voted by Parliament to build new Anglican churches, to increase representation of manufacturing towns.

- **Coal Wagon** \- rolls through town [PIC](https://c8.alamy.com/comp/BFY9TJ/coal-mining-about-1800-wagon-on-railway-tracks-is-pulled-back-to-mine-BFY9TJ.jpg). Coal is being delivered everywhere. Indoors, it is fetched from "the coal pile" and carried, in well mannered families, in the Coal Bucket [PIC](https://www.sellingantiques.co.uk/photosnew/dealer_sgthings/dealer_sgthings_highres_1635240666992-8183024356.jpg)

- **March of the Blanketeers** saw 400 spinners and weavers march from Manchester to London in March 1817 to hand the Government a petition  
- **Repeal the Corn Laws** \- Henton is accosted by an old friend who urges him. The Year Without a Summer, now turning into to years, has created horrible economic conditions in England. The [Corn Laws](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corn_Laws) (corn meaning "all grains") are protectionist measures halting the import of much-needed grain, forcing the price of bread through the roof. That damn Castlereagh is keeping down the common man\!  
- **Middle Class** A young man stands on a soap box on the street corner heralding the emergence of a "middle class", the new backbone of England. Traders, clarks, men of business, these are the foundation for a more just society  
  - Henton or Lucius get a premonition of the [Peterloo Massacre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peterloo_Massacre) in 1819  
- **Luddite Pamplet** \- talks about the evil of factories, the many deaths and maimings. Everyone scoffs at this. The lower classes are lower.  
- **May Day** \- Experience the crowning of the May Queen in London, followed by processions of Morris dancers that parade through the town. Incorporate elements from Beltane, the Festival of Flora, and Walpurgis Night.  
- **Dinky Derrick** \- You pass Streaky, begging with a cup on an overturned crate. His eyes are dull and he wears a bandage wrap about his head. In the nearby alley, thugs beat up a man in an alley. Old Farm is seen making his escape with Duff. The victim is Dinky Derrick, who has unwisely flaunted his gold and had it stolen.  
- **Restoration** \- the British government is, in general, very self-congratulatory about the restoration of the Ancien Regime. The prince regent started calling Louis king well before the moment of actual restoration. Very pro-regime propaganda in London for years \- for the British population, restoration meant peace while Boney meant war.  
- **Shrovetide** A french preacher asks if you have prepared your lenten sacrifice.  
  - He asks you to "make a special point of self-examination, of considering what wrongs you need to repent, and what amendments of life or areas of spiritual growth you especially need to ask God's help in dealing with."  
  - Lenten sacrifice is typically renouncing booze, sweets, meat, or other vices.  
  - Shrovetide is the pre-lent time when people get in their last pre-lent indulgences   
  - participating in confession and absolution  
  - Ritual burning of the previous year's Holy Week palms (stored for a year)  
  - Finalizing one's Lenten sacrifice  
  - [**Shrove Tuesday**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shrove_Tuesday) is the day before Ash Wednesday  
  - In French the term is **Mardi Gras**, "Fat Tuesday"  
- **Gahan Coal Unloading** \- A collier unloads coal from a cart directly into a coal vault. This practice prevents dirty coal sacks from being dragged through the house. Coal, for fires and the kitchen, is dumped down a chute via the "coal hole". The design of the coal hatch, which was locked from the inside, would vary from house to house. Gahan learns to pick this lock.

# The Meeting

April 1st \- call on March 21st at exactly 8am eastern because that is when the schedule opens up.

\<\< It is the catatonic's spirits that are trying to leave their body, says Quintus. Not dead, clearly, but not fully alive. The nerrosium king nearly had her, and still pulls at her. It made her spirit seek freedom, and reject her body.\>\>

### Location

Enter by a brothel in the printing district [PIC](http://victorian-era.org/images/prostitution-in-georgian-era.jpg). The brothel has entrances all around the block, and even blocks away, so access not everyone is seen entering at once.

In a reading room sits Reginald Castlebury, who greeted you when you were recruited in Winchester Cathedral.

Behind a bookcase, take a passage for 100m to the Samuel Dash [ice storage](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/london-archaeologists-unearth-subterranean-georgian-ice-store-180971146/). [PIC](https://th-thumbnailer.cdn-si-edu.com/LmC7lq1IN4Nhq1PyM2qKOt8KsKA=/1000x750/filters:no_upscale\(\)/https://tf-cmsv2-smithsonianmag-media.s3.amazonaws.com/filer/1b/78/1b7836e8-16bd-46ab-9e3c-25b3ef308c29/buildings_archaeologists_from_mola_record_the_interior_of_the_regents_crescent_ice_house_c_mola_banner.jpg) Hay insulation, as well as the underground nature of the store, which stretched 25 feet wide and 31 feet deep, kept ice in prime selling condition.

Cross the ice, and take a winding stairway down to a dead end. Retreat seven steps and speak the word "Gaslight".

Written over the door is "Evil to him who evil thinks" (motto of the Order of the Garter)

The party meets the Enlightened in a large chamber of Roman design, ancient, lit by candle light. It is a replica of the pattern of the Pantheon [PIC](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9b/Pantheon11111.jpg), in miniature. At this point you are directly below the Young Memnon.

### The Grants

82,000 pounds sterling in gold ($9M)  
Reward of 500/yr stipend ($60,000)

1) **The group** seemed to choose Easter Island, spooky and barren of life, as their destination.  
2) **Biggles Poodle** \- rolled difficulty 11, and the poodle offered "I will cure the catatonics if, after you pass, I may have the use of your spirit for a while." It is Mephistopheles, one of the wards, and "for a time" means it will possess his spirit   
3) **Constance killed** Duff and Old Farm, after they beat up and stole from Dinky Derrick. She restored much of his gold.  
4) Bolton was shown the **Steampunk Submarine**. They will take underwater tunnels to cross from one side of the earth to visit Easter Island...

All go to sub; within London Bridge in a big hidden marble room.

Wellington: Its a fake. On to the real one men.

Easter was just "[invented](https://regencyredingote.wordpress.com/2018/03/16/regency-bicentennial-the-earliest-easter/)", formerly Resurrection Day; Named after Eostre, the Old English goddess of the Dawn and Spring.

This very early Easter date created a rare coincidence which some people believed was a strong portent of some serious misfortune which would befall England. This coincidence not only caused Easter Sunday to fall very close to Lady Day, it actually caused Easter to come three days before Lady Day (25 March). (A very ancient tradition held that the Crucifixion took place on 25 March, the same date as Lady Day. Though this specific date is not recorded in scripture, there were many in England who were aware of the supposed date.) A doggerel couplet which was well known during the Regency captures the attitude of many people toward the fell portent of the juxtaposition of Easter and Lady Day:

When my Lord falls in my Lady’s lap,  
England, beware of some mishap\!

Barron's device was developed further in 1818 by Jeremiah Chubb, who incorporated into the lock a spring which would catch and hold any lever that had been raised too high by a lock picker. Not only did this add an extra level of security, it showed when the lock had been tampered with.

# The Enlightened

Objective:  
Put an end to the machinations of the purveyors of injustice, to control them without dominating them.

The Bavarian Illuminati were Waldensians, and being open cost them dearly: stamped out in fourteen years.

Add Johann Goethe to the council, age 68, he escaped persecution of the Bavarian Illuminati and came under cover to England.

Faust, Part 1 from 1808, depicts actual events reframed in Judeo-Christian allegory. He yet continues work on part two. It contains Secrets, and when he releases it he will die of bad luck.

Its members pledged obedience to their superiors and were divided into three main classes: the first included “novices,” “minervals,” and “lesser illuminati”; the second consisted of freemasons (“ordinary,” “Scottish,” and “Scottish knights”); and the third or “mystery” class comprised two grades of “priest” and “regent” as well as “magus” and “king.”

# Magic

Henton			revelationism  
Throckmorton		naturalism  
Lucius			mentalism \- is there a Meta Lucius who can spend fate points to "know" and act on prior knowledge, or knowledge from his experiences through time.  
Bolton			spine gradually entering his body, welding to his vertebrae  
Gahan			

They can see kabbalah sigils. In graffiti. Cracks in sidewalk pavement. 

**Open Questions**

What was taken from the Black Opal King?

Looting the... Ashanti library, treasury, forge, menagerie? Just say they have what they need...

**Key Action**

* Learn of illuminati  
* Clue in on signs of the secret war  
* Return home, and meet the leaders  
* Napoleon was trying to cleanse Europe, but got out of control  
* Mega-Frost   
* Revelations of the corruptor's end state for humanity  
* Experience forgetting about KG3  
* Destroy the Ward of Ignorance

Mr. Mump will disclose, during the long sail home

1. That a group called the **Illuminati** exist. A cell of leaders in England, loosely connected through the Benedictines to other, unknown cells in Europe.  
2. Mr. Mump will tell his [Story](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XKPxM6rK3SaS3SsGOQzTFo8N8Zd2coQEFBlk59YJk1Y/edit)

.

Entering port, they get inspected. The ship is identified as stolen, and all their gold is taken.

Henges \- Idea: Degenerism and generism to move things through time. Eg visit Stonehenge and degen it to the original rectangles and find an underground entrance. Link between Zayan ziggurat telescope and Stonehenge?

Constance hired by gold mine owner \- don't let that ship reach the economy\!

Don't go to prison or get assassinated for two months.

Experience the opening of parliament \- for entertainment

- See the black opal rod used to knock three times \- what does it mean that its material matches the 5th ward's bones? Dark spirits hover about it.  
- In 1642 John Hampden & four others attempted arrest by Charles 1  
- See King G's speech \- it is apparent he is corrupted.

Meet a convocation of the leading illuminati.

* Maria Fitzherbert  
* Regent George IV  
* Arkwright  
* Beau Brummel

## **Adventure Options**

Oil wars in underground easter island caves

Jupiter ringworld below the clouds, or a city near the core where less gravity

Is King G the ward of dominion \- wanting to megalomaniac own everything. Or alienation from the commons

## **Themes**

Will's idea for Thematic Core  
Tangibly it is averting industrialization and the destruction of nature, but thematically it is averting alienation and dehumanization.

The players now SEE THE SECRET WAR. Glyphs, some partial and filled in with unseen completion, and some fully unseen. They are slightly warm, so they discolor rained-on walls, or make show melt slightly more on roofs.

FORGETTING \- the players discover that they have forgotten something(s). The actual human players don't know, because of course we never actually played it. But they go through the discovery bit by bit. Idea: tell a player that X happened during a prior session they missed, but it isn't what happened. Maybe Gahan's Obscura...

REVELATIONS \- of the corruptor's purposes and designs  
\<\< revelation of the corruptor's purpose? \>\>

TRANSFORMED WORLD \- Eventual destruction of the FIrst Ward, of ignorance, transforms the world into one in which magic is real, known, an prevalent.

COAL \- [link](https://www.jstor.org/stable/24953925) and oil are dark black manifestations of the Corruptor, meant to transition from forests eventually to climate change the world. Simultaneously, the industrial revolution increases dehumanization and ease of callous actions. Coal industrialists are corrupted, and anti-illuminati.

Open a Door \- callous acts have dark spirit possession or attention linked to them.

Angular glyph lines are used to summon dark spirits and bind them to maleficent purposes. It never happens instantly, but may occur during the course of days, often embodied in a bad luck animal like a crow, goat or black cat.

Back to Djoser \- wooly mammoths were still alive at this time.

Preaching at the docks:

*So says Romans 13:12: "The night is far spent, the day is at hand: let us therefore cast off the works of darkness, and let us put on the Armor of Light. Let us walk honestly, as in the day."*

*These words herald the coming of the Lord, in his majesty, to judge the quick and the dead, in the final hours of existence, and none may escape that day. No king, no soldier, no tanner, no smith, for all shall be judged. Many are the signs and warnings which God has graciously given in his Holy Word, to the end that this great and terrible day, however it may overtake the world, may not overtake people unawares. The night is far spent\!*

*Our globe-spanning empire finds the beasts in their depredations. They must be delivered\! Ever subtle are the works of evil. Let the lord guide our hands\! Let us cast off the works of darkness\!*

*Thessalonians says, "Let us, who are of the day, be sober, putting on the breastplate of faith and love, and for a helmet the hope of salvation. God bless prince regent George. Let his instrument of Empire cleanse the wicked of the world, and all who hear these words: You are of the day, and must do the works of the day. Put on the armor of light\!"*

The writing on the Cosmati pavement:

*"In the year of Christ one thousand two hundred and twelve plus sixty minus four, the third King Henry, the city, Odoricus and the abbot put these porphyry stones together.*

*If the reader wisely considers all that is laid down, he will find here the end of the primum mobile; a hedge (lives for) three years, add dogs and horses and men, stags and ravens, eagles, enormous whales, the world: each one following triples the years of the one before."*

Plot

* **Mump** emerges from the gold coffin. It looked empty, but this is his power  
* **Task** Mump says must find any living babies or toddlers asap.  
* **Henton** \- sees spirits being pulled towards the collapsed pyramid room  
* **Palace Steps** \- all crew members are struck unconscious. PCs must save  
* **Bad Luck** \- Progressing, ever-building bad luck. See "Night Children" below.  
* **Melted puddles** of wax, with footsteps in them, leading into the treasure room  
* **Night Children**: Deep black children with no eyes run around, hard to see in the dark. With eye sockets but no eyes. Ear holes but no ears. A mouth but no tongue.  
* **Crew** \- Tubby, Terence, Beard, Davey C, Ruby

Records Room (below the library)

* Uniforms of enemies  
* Book: **Chronicles of the Bantu empire**, in meticulous detail.  
  * Mwari, the first emperor  
  * The Bantu peoples also spread their stateless societies. Stateless societies lacked a centralized hierarchy of government officials and a bureaucracy and instead were led by family groups that balanced the ruling power among them and made decisions together for the good of the whole society.  
* Book: **Plague Apocrypha**  
  * The plague of 1347 was due to revelations about the Corruptor, which he eliminated. Bahmani Sultanate  
  * The 1818 plague is the same. A network of Sufi and hindu mystics delved too deep, and shared too much.  
* Book: **Blank**  
  *   
* Book: **Codes of the Living Man**  
* Leather rubbing oil. When applied to the blank book these words surface: "Those who rule the mightiest empires rightly believe themselves gods, indifferent to the plight of all their fellow men".  
  * This triggers a forward memory in Lucius:  
  * Lucius has been in the future: The British empire will be the largest empire in history and, for over a century, the foremost global power. In 100 years the Empire will hold sway over 412 million people, 25 per cent of the world population. 99% of them were subjugated by 1%. Only defeating Mwari can avert that future.

By 1913 the British Empire held sway over 412 million people, 23 per cent of the world population at the time, and by 1920 it covered 35,500,000 km2 (13,700,000 sq mi), 24 percent of the Earth's total land area.Laboratory (below the gold forge)

Palace & Grounds

* **Penny** is swooning in the harem  
* It becomes clear that the palace is coplanar with the ancient Bantu king's palace. It was he that positioned himself as a god, opening the door to become the fifth ward. His name was Mwari.  
* **Parrot**: Five Toe Pete has carried it into the ship  
* **Diplomats**: Find the diplomats slaughtered.

Sun streams in shafts from small holes above. Numerous forest tree roots seek from the ceiling into the water, creating perfectly round root bundles. The water is so still, pure and clear blue that disturbing it feels like a violation. Across the chamber is a carved stone tomb of surpassing workmanship, laced with gold and ivory.*

- All feel compelled to leap or climb between islands.  
- Entering the water causes roots to spring from the ceiling, wrap around the person, and they begin to turn to calcium unless pulled free within 60 seconds.  
- On a central island is a stone monument inset with gold. Tree roots lace into it from above.

Objective: Extract the black relic from the [Black Opal King](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ml4MhMjmapNTFYD-ifeZb_XncwotmAcRF9zSmtC7zb0/edit#bookmark=id.q7k4f6yh3n9i) staked under water and smash it. When you do, half of all the members of the king's household (anyone not protected) simply drop dead. You will see the bodies on your way out. Any remaining wax people melt.

- Return to find Twum Ampofo murdered  
  - Afia is now regent  
  - She says he was never cut out for rulership anyway, and takes the Ofori stool immediately.

## **Completion**

Return to the coast.

* Learn that Afia's uncle died, and she is now Asantehene of the Akyem.  
* While waiting to set sail, meet Maitland.

Captain [Frederick Maitland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederick_Lewis_Maitland_\(Royal_Navy_officer\)) of [HMS *Bellerophon*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMS_Bellerophon_\(1786\)) testifies that "it was not Napoleon" that surrendered to him on 15 July, 1815\. Yes, it appeared to be. No, he never mentioned Josephine's death. We had dinner aboard ship. He was quiet. But his eyes had no soul. I shall always recall those dead, dead eyes.

# People

### King Tutu

The king's short story is that he is a malignant narcissist similar to Ron Hubbard, Sun Myung Moon, Idi Amin, etc. Never wrong. Always the most important.

**The King** *appeared to be about thirty-eight years of age, inclined to corpulence, and of a benevolent countenance ; he wore a fillet of aggry beads round his temples, a necklace of gold cock- spur shells strung by their largest ends, and over his right shoulder a red silk cord, suspending three saphies cased in gold ; his bracelets were the richest mixtures of beads and gold, and his fingers covered with rings ; his cloth was of a dark green silk ; a pointed diadem was elegantly painted in white on his forehead ; also a pattern resembling an epaulette on each shoulder, and an ornament like a full blown rose, one leaf rising above another until it covered his whole breast ; his knee-bands were of aggr}-^ beads, and his ancle strings of gold ornaments of the most delicate M'ork- manship, small drums, sankos, stools, swords, guns, and birds, clustered together ; his sandals, of a soft white leather, were em- bossed across the instep band with small gold and silver cases of saphies ; he was seated in a low chair, richly ornamented with gold ; he wore a pair of gold castanets on his finger and thumb, which he clapped to enforce silence. The belts of the guards behind his chair, were cased in gold, and covered with small jaw bones of the same metal ; the elephants tails, waving like a small cloud before him, were spangled with gold, and large plumes of feathers were flourished amid them. His eunuch presided over these attendants, wearing only one massy piece of gold about his neck : the royal stool, entirely cased in gold, was displayed under a splendid umbrella, with drums, sankos, horns, and various mu- sical instruments, cased in gold, about the thickness of cartridge paper : large circles of gold hung by scarlet cloth from the swords of state, the sheaths as well as the handles of which were also cased ; hatchets of the same were intermixed with them : the breasts of the Ocrahs, and various attendants, were adorned with large stars, stools, crescents, and gossamer wings of solid gold.*  
**Apokoo** \- the royal treasurer; ostentatious display of his service ; the blow pan, boxes, scales and weights, were of solid gold; Also an elderly general.  
**Linguists** \- Four men, each with a gold cane of office; Quashie, the Accra Unguist,  
Akobo \- Executioner. The executioner, a man of an immense size, wore a massy gold hatchet on his breast ; and the execution stool was held before him, clotted in blood, and partly covered with a cawl of fat.  
**Odumata** \- one of the four aristocrats ; he begged us to drink palm wine with him, and ordered a large jar of it to be sent to our servants. He told us he was the first captain who fought with the English at Annamaboe 

# Factions

- **Ashanti** \- inlanders responding to colonialism push to the sea with war to access Euro traders; In control, but angered about the halting of slave trading years prior. See Ashanti Summary below.
