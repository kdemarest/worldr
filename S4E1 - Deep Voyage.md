**Gahan** \- haunted with visions of the prokithera device permuting. Emeralds heighten his int. He becomes obsessed before he discovers its secrets.

**Lucius** \- haunted by visions of the [Muzo](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Muzo_people) natives treatment by the Spanish occupiers in 1620, specifically the Pope's delegate; But he also sees their warlike origins, occasional cannibalism, living near waterfalls, killing their bristle haired babies, hunting with curare darts, enslaving their war-taken neighbors. The emeralds in the cross give him a vision of the future.

# **Phases**

## Preface

**Visions**

1. The destruction of the submersible was a vision, seen only by Henton and, due to her special bond with him, Constance. Gahan got echoes of it through the rings. Wellington has them escorted to the observation deck to recover themselves with some tea.  
2. Henton isn't sleeping, at all, except to enter fevered dreams from which he startles awake, remembering nothing. Lucius must read his mind, revealing the Dutch Agents.  
3. These things lead to seeing phrenologist German physician Franz Joseph Gall [PIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franz_Joseph_Gall#/media/File:Franz_Josef_Gall3.jpg), at Quintus' behest. There are indications of who is susceptible to corruption by their phrenological characteristics. So-called "embedded spirits" can hide from normal detection. Unclear how they are implanted, but the phrenology can be used to ferret them out.

**Wellington**

1. We learn that he is deeply superstitious, listening carefully to Quintus and other mystics  
2. He tells of the 1500s explorations of Portugal, the fall of Spanish Empire in the 1600s, the rise of the Dutch East India company, and England's eventual supremacy. How can the empire be made to endure? Money felled the Spanish, like the loss of the Atocha.  
3. Wellington was appointed Master-General of the Ordnance in the Tory government of Lord Liverpool on 26 December 1818\. He became Governor of Plymouth on 9 October 1819\.

**Dutch Agents** are spotted, leading the group to a warehouse.

1. Throckmorton discovers the remains of a vat of Nitric Acid (HNO3), and a spill of Sulphur. Nitroglycerine won't be invented until 1846, as far as the world knows.  
2. Bolton is invited to stay with Tawnsy, but she has been overthrown and plants a Mind Tap spirit upon him. Once done she will be found unconscious, suffering from wheezing breath, saveable by Throckmorton.

## Progression

1. **Vote** \- are we doing submarine combat?  
   1. **Armament** \- Let the players invent the armament, defenses and weaponry for the ship.  
   2. **Training** \- Everyone must learn to swim, and to hold their breaths, operate a spear gun, and lift a heavy object from 20' deep water.  
2. **Crew** \- The crew is established. Discover that Captain Hervey was killed during the attack.  
3. **Tuktu** \- The Netsilik who brought [tidings](https://static.dw.com/image/45048418_303.jpg), and tells the ways of the frost lands. [Details](#bookmark=id.rnkwvd9o0oz0)  
4. **Tour** \- The reactors are shown, with ampules of uranium visible within each  
5. **Orders**  
   1. We suspect Easter Island is somehow complicit in the madness of King George.  
   2. Strange visions and psychic emanations have been detected by Quintus. Henton's vision was, perhaps, one such.  
   3. Varulate the natives. Explore reports of witch doctors and living stone men.  
   4. If any crew are killed, take over for them and continue. There are no replacements for them.  
6. **Wellington Quotes** \- ([source](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Arthur_Wellesley,_1st_Duke_of_Wellington))  
   1. Nothing except a battle lost can be half so melancholy as a battle won.  
   2. I never saw so many shocking bad hats in my life.  
   3. We always have been, we are, and I hope that we always shall be, detested in France.  
   4. I have seen their backs before, madam.  
   5. The French system of conscription brings together a fair sample of all classes; ours is composed of the scum of the earth — the mere scum of the earth. It is only wonderful that we should be able to make so much out of them afterwards.  
   6. The history of a battle, is not unlike the history of a ball. Some individuals may recollect all the little events of which the great result is the battle won or lost, but no individual can recollect the order in which, or the exact moment at which, they occurred, which makes all the difference as to their value or importance.  
7. **Furniture** is brought in, plus a grand piano. A full bar. A large dining table.   
8. **Training**  
   1. The existing crew obviously barely know how to operate the craft. They are young, and smart, but inexperienced.  
   2. The squid was a warped Zocto spirit. There is a bleeding together of the spirit world and the real world. Something is happening. Perhaps the gestation of a new ward.  
   3. They find a gate, and see the spirit squid coming through. It can be destroyed.  
   4. A huge school of fish will surround them, fleeing from a pod of dolphins. One can hide within it.  
   5. Shallows.

**Boarding day**  
Dutch Agents use nitroglycerin to blow it up, only for it be revealed that it was a model, a trap set by the shrewd Duke of Wellington. They are hurried onto the real Nautilus.

Someone (~~Bolton~~ Henton) has a mind tap. Lucius can detect and extract the tap, once Henton divines the nationality and origin of the shackled spirit.

After, everyone is sequestered in apartments in the London Bridge, for training and for security of the mission.

Intellect, stranger in a strange land, far from home. "Something no longer living, sent against you."

## The Voyage

The oversea voyage of Roggeveen to Easter Island took 9 months. This is too long for Wellington's liking. He aims to take empty lava tunnels toward the earth's center and, using the heated flow, back up again.

## \!Wreck of the Atocha

Recover gold and emeralds from the **Nuestra Senora de Atocha**, sunk in 1622 [PIC](https://www.history.com/.image/t_share/MTU3ODc4NjAyNzEyODE5NDIz/image-placeholder-title.jpg), [deets](https://elementalanalysis.com/the-wreck-of-the-nuestra-senora-de-atocha/), the [story](https://4cs.gia.edu/en-us/blog/sunken-treasure-atocha/). ​​Atocha is a central ward (barrio) of Madrid.

Just before arrival, see a hammerhead mating swarm: [vid](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsWuJtQpgsw).

Biggles has an eel DC 5 on his face. [PIC](https://c8.alamy.com/comp/PBADNR/fangtooth-moray-eel-enchelycore-anatina-with-mouth-open-grand-canaria-canary-islands-spain-east-atlantic-ocean-PBADNR.jpg), hammerhead [vid](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsWuJtQpgsw), man harpooning whale from canoe [pic](https://farm1.static.flickr.com/955/26992886537_978c8e1edb_b.jpg), wreck ambiance [pic](https://media.istockphoto.com/vectors/blue-underwater-landscape-vector-id870154080?k=20&m=870154080&s=612x612&w=0&h=dBAupFdg3KtVLcblmmqd9jP8LiKkPVFMY0D127t-QIk=)

A Kraken, various Ghost Squid, and Red Barnacles have taken up residence in the ship. When attacked by the Ghost Squid the acid kills or scars the lungs of most crew. The cross-trained PCs must stand in for all positions. 

The Hold: 10 tons of gold and 30 tons of silver, 255,000 coins (welded together by seawater), along with 70 pounds of emeralds when it was wrecked by a hurricane in September 1622, between Spain and Iceland (but off Florida in real life).

Denizens:

* **Yellow eels** inhabit the captain's cabin where the emeralds are stored. There is a magnificent emerald tipped cane under the bed.  
* **Captain Alonso Turillo de Yerba** [pic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_IV_of_Spain#/media/File:Philip_IV_of_Spain_-_Vel%C3%A1zquez_1644.jpg) haunts the interior. He and his crew relive the sinking over and over again.

Recovered cross [pic](https://4cs.gia.edu/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Emerald-set-crucifix-Nuestra-Senora-de-Atocha.jpg)

Treasure Recoverable:

* Emerald Cross [PIC](https://historia.nationalgeographic.com.es/medio/2012/11/15/nationalgeographic_437153_2000x1596.jpg)  
* 1 ton coins [PIC](https://elementalanalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/case_wreck_medium.jpg) & [PIC](https://www.bronzelady2000.com/wp-content/uploads/IMG_0404.jpg)  
* 1 ton silver bars [PIC](https://www.sedwickcoins.com/articles/atocha_bar/atocha7.jpg), [DEETS](https://www.sedwickcoins.com/articles/atocha2.htm)  
* 1 ton gold bars [PIC](http://image.timepassagesnostalgia.com/watermarked/imagesl8/l882goldbara.jpg).   
* 20 lb bag of emeralds

Inside the cross, they find many of these coins: [https://www.bronzelady2000.com/wp-content/uploads/IMG\_0404.jpg](https://www.bronzelady2000.com/wp-content/uploads/IMG_0404.jpg)  
The cross, and its accursing spirits, was the proximate cause of the sinking of the Nuestra.

\*\* What does the emerald capped mahogany cane do? Is it our first magic object? It must have a spirit linkage.

- Aura of royalty?  
- Perhaps invoking it rips the soul from a living sentient into the emerald, rendering them dead. But done unjustly it becomes a severe haunting

The bullion is found on the sea bed around the wreck, along with the Prokithera device.

**Prokithera** device \- Mysterious nav-like, pseudo-gold instrument. It is a Zocto 3d space navigation device, capable of predicting the location of Jupiter sufficient to open a gate to it, or travel there via spacecraft. All solar system objects may be thus predicted. This will matter later. Meant for operation with 8 arms, four are x,y,z,time, and the remaining four are used for predictions and extreme precision.

## Iceland

Of course the British have a secret base here. Their empire has made them privy to many secrets. In fact there's a whole secrets division of the foreign service.

**Danish Iceland**  
When the two kingdoms of Denmark and Norway were separated by the Treaty of Kiel in 1814 following the Napoleonic Wars, Denmark kept Iceland, as well as Faroe and Greenland, as dependencies.

**Independence movement**  
Throughout the 19th century, the country's climate continued to grow worse, resulting in mass emigration to the New World, particularly Manitoba in Canada. However, a new national consciousness was revived in Iceland, inspired by romantic nationalist ideas from continental Europe. This revival was spearheaded by the Fjölnismenn, a group of Danish-educated Icelandic intellectuals.

An independence movement developed under the leadership of a lawyer named Jón Sigurðsson. In 1843, a new Althing was founded as a consultative assembly. It claimed continuity with the Althing of the Icelandic Commonwealth, which had remained for centuries as a judicial body and had been abolished in 1800\.
