# Viking Settlement

There should really be more encounters with whaling and seal hunting. Even Britain sent 50 ships a year into the area between Canada and Greenland. This was essentially the peak of w h a l i n g.

Also note that the British were frequently pressing Americans into service on their ships around this time and that was one of the causes of the war of 1812\.

The **Treaty of Ghent (1815)** had just ended hostilities with the U.S., restoring their access to fishing grounds under contested diplomatic conditions. It reopened North Atlantic trade and the **Newfoundland and Labrador fisheries**, returning to roughly pre-war conditions. And in 1817 the two sides demilitarized the Great lakes.

Ships carried timber, fish, furs, and whale oil from the northwest Atlantic back to British ports, and manufactured goods outbound.

Also don't forget the romanticism of icebergs the auroras and of course sighting whales or giant squid

**Maritime superstition** remained strong, often stronger than formal religion. Common beliefs included:

* **Never whistle on deck** (it calls up winds or storms).

* **Albatrosses** were sacred—killing one invited disaster.

* **Women aboard** were bad luck.

* **Cats, pigs, or priests** on the dock before sailing were ill omens.

* **The first catch** of the whaling season was treated with ceremony—sometimes a toast or symbolic blood offering to the sea.

# **\!Ross Expedition** {#!ross-expedition}

In 1818, Captain John **Ross** [PIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Ross_\(Royal_Navy_officer\)#/media/File:British_School_-_Sir_John_Ross_\(1777%E2%80%931856\)_-_BHC2983_-_Royal_Museums_Greenwich.jpg) took the naval ships Isabella and the (smaller, slower) Alexander, captained by William Edward **Parry** [PIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Edward_Parry#/media/File:Captain_William_Edward_Parry_\(1790-1855\),_by_Charles_Skottowe.jpg), under instructions to go northward through Davis Strait and Baffin Bay and attempt to find an open passage round the north-east corner of North America, and ultimately reach the Pacific through Bering Strait.

Ross has mis-perceived mountains enclosing the inlet, causing his to turn around. Parry disagrees, and in 1819 will return to seek the route. Alexander, being a much smaller vessel than Isabella, had fallen behind and Parry had not seen the mountains that Ross claimed to have sighted. [Link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Ross_\(Royal_Navy_officer\)#1818:_First_Arctic_expedition)

They escort the party, first rescuing a crushed whaler 

Ross will depart for England, leaving Parry to escort the party.

# **\!Crushed Whaler** {#!crushed-whaler}

After meeting Ross, and dinner together on his ship, the next morning a whaler, the "Acushnet", being crushed by ice is spotted from the crow's nest.

Only the sub can enter the open water, past the ice, that gets them closer to the wreck. Any rescue must cross ice slabs [PIC](https://images.fineartamerica.com/images/artworkimages/mediumlarge/1/broken-ice-up-close-geralyn-palmer.jpg). [SOUNDS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXeLTqKs4gA) Parry will show up with a dog sled as the rescue completes.

At the crushed ship, which is mostly below the ice slabs, two sailors attempt to free the cook who is submerged in water up to his waist. They were sent for supplies and had a mishap 24 hours ago.

The sailors, Finnegan and Carl are exhausted. The cook Jacob has a smashed leg, but it isn't bleeding because of the extreme cold. As it thaws it will bleed. His face and lips are blue.

Nearby, Bill lies crushed where a longboat slid backwards and smashed his head. Also, Finnegan's longboat is afloat nearby.

Two more longboats are visible on the shore. They were dragged over the jagged ice floes to save the crew by transporting them to shore. See the Abandoned Viking Cove for details. The whaler's captain is Capt. Bram Van Wooten, but he is somewhere on shore.

# **\!Cabot's Ships** {#!cabot's-ships}

If the bay floor is searched underwater, Cabot's ship "The Matthew" will be found, along with the four other ships of his expedition all in a row, their anchors deployed.

Each is generally intact except for ice crushing damage and the ravages of time, lying on its side (implying the ships were abandoned and left to the ice).

The Matthew has a large hole in one side. Cabot will recall having two large statues removed from the mine area on either side of the Ice Veil. Here is a drawing he can make of one [PIC](https://images-wixmp-ed30a86b8c4ca887773594c2.wixmp.com/f/487cbce0-dcd6-4bd2-8e1c-03988397662b/df99bc6-95b61620-d18b-49aa-b683-f59f91625936.jpg?token=eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJzdWIiOiJ1cm46YXBwOjdlMGQxODg5ODIyNjQzNzNhNWYwZDQxNWVhMGQyNmUwIiwiaXNzIjoidXJuOmFwcDo3ZTBkMTg4OTgyMjY0MzczYTVmMGQ0MTVlYTBkMjZlMCIsIm9iaiI6W1t7InBhdGgiOiJcL2ZcLzQ4N2NiY2UwLWRjZDYtNGJkMi04ZTFjLTAzOTg4Mzk3NjYyYlwvZGY5OWJjNi05NWI2MTYyMC1kMThiLTQ5YWEtYjY4My1mNTlmOTE2MjU5MzYuanBnIn1dXSwiYXVkIjpbInVybjpzZXJ2aWNlOmZpbGUuZG93bmxvYWQiXX0.H5YmYG_TjxpXS3mbLgfBrMSI7nG6oCxNMeGgF_EyZkQ).

There are no bodies on the ships, but a skeletal arm severed below the elbow may be found, the bone deeply gouged as if by talons.

# **\!Hvithross, the Viking Settlement** {#!hvithross,-the-viking-settlement}

Two longboats sit on the shore. A glacier (Coronation Glacier) [PIC](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f6/Coronation_Glacier_5_2001-07-23.jpg/1280px-Coronation_Glacier_5_2001-07-23.jpg) abuts the sea here, flowing down over modestly sized cliffs and melting in the sea. The players may choose to name the glacier.

Nearby are two ancient huts from the viking village, and also skogafoss waterfall. Behind the waterfall is a glacial cave. Inside, the lensing of the sun has made everything verdant with grass and flowers. It is warm enough and bright enough that this is where the horses live. Descendants of horses used to haul slag, mining gear, run the capstan, and ride north to hunting grounds.

**Ross's Perspective** \- If anyone tries to get Ross's men to help, Ross will say no, but Bolton will find the Marque of the Prince Regent authorizing all true servants of the empire to assist Bolton no matter the cost.

**Perry's Perspective** \- He will help, especially by lending men such as Francis the expert Rigger (great with ropes and capstans).

**Misfortune**

Assuming the blank books are revealed in the light of Ooron (the uranium that powers the ship) bad luck will cause everything to go wrong, clogging the cooling ducts with a human skull (from Cabot's ship).

Taking longboats from the sub will save it, but orca will attack.

* Swamp Them \- while in longboats by creating a bow wave in a groups, and  
* Ambush them \- when they landed on shore by riding a natural wave up and chomping their legs, then dragging them to sea.  
* Anyone grabbed into the water will be tossed like seals.

## Viking Village {#viking-village}

[Pic](https://img.atlasobscura.com/ReZrZfVcZllWOK3f2XhJQCf2emyaG8nD0BMvWbGQzzk/rt:fit/h:390/q:81/sm:1/scp:1/ar:1/aHR0cHM6Ly9hdGxh/cy1kZXYuczMuYW1h/em9uYXdzLmNvbS91/cGxvYWRzL3BsYWNl/X2ltYWdlcy8wYjNh/MmQyMjc5ODMzNWI1/MTVfVmlraW5nIDMu/anBn.jpg)  
These huts are backed up against the base of the glacier. Warm ashes from a fire (made by the American whaler crew) are here, and also very old, extremely dry benches and some rusted tools. It looks like rust oxidation happens faster than rot, due to the cold.

### Skogafoss Waterfall {#skogafoss-waterfall}

## Ice Cave {#ice-cave}

[pic](https://preview.redd.it/v917x9ae01qy.jpg?width=960&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=04a8a774e73d6bad3b57cef34ce3ec8d96484b84)  
The lensing, verdant ice cave is 200' across and 60 to 80' tall. (100 acres for the horses). The horses graze peacefully here amidst tall green grass dotted with flowers. The sun must lens from above, keeping all green and healthy within.

**Horses** \- One may attempt to lure and/or train a white horse, difficulty 4\. The horses can carry people, expedition gear, etc. The vesperna might carry one off.

**Wooden Warrior Icon** \- within the grass one might find a viking carving of wood. It is heavier than normal, because it is filled with silver, but one must discover that by opening the bottom. [PIC](https://i.etsystatic.com/27301435/r/il/55d467/2805591314/il_794xN.2805591314_6ukc.jpg)

**Silver Valkyrie** \- Also findable within the grass, or in the ashes of the viking fireplace, or within an inset casket.

### 0.25 mi \- Viking Cabin  {#0.25-mi---viking-cabin}

The American whaler crew is within. They have slaughtered a horse, hung its corpse on a scaffold to process it. Inside they are drunk, eating the meat. About 1/4th mile in can be found an old viking hut similar to those found on shore. Eight American sailors, crass and vigorous men, will be found inside. The captain and first mate left yesterday to scout further into the cave. While they will claim the captain told them not to pursue, the fact is they slaughtered a horse, feasted and got completely drunk. They have propped an ancient viking skeleton up in a chair at the table, and are playing staring contests or drink with it using a pewter drinking mug. 

### 0.50 mi \- Darkness Waterfall {#0.50-mi---darkness-waterfall}

Half a mile more and the overhead ice gets thicker, making the light dim and the grass fail. At the boundary of live grass is a waterfall. Within you will see shiny glimpses, which are silver ingots. Attempting to enter brings bad luck, easy to slip, lose your wind, even drown. Five ingots can be retrieved. [PIC](https://i.pinimg.com/550x/86/67/a4/8667a4bfb5c64e9974025190bacbccb7.jpg)

### 1.00 mi \- Silver Mine and Ruins {#1.00-mi---silver-mine-and-ruins}

See below.

### Leyden Tubes {#leyden-tubes}

A so-called Leyden Shaft is a broad shaft straight into the earth that various C minions, notably the Ioans, use both for **transportation** from earth's core to surface, and also as a form of Leyden jar to project **communication** signals from earth to Jupiter.

Such shafts range from 3' to 90' wide, and at some point near the top the shape becomes perfectly circular, and is lined with an obsidian alloy called "sidium" that acts like glass encased within a foil of silver. Purple flecks are visible within the sidium, assuming enough light.

Transportation: Leyden tubes may be traveled up or down with a Leyden Wain, the primary characteristic of which is that it projects magnetism to four sides of the tube, thus controlling its speed via the [Lenz's Law](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7tIi71-AjA). It can rise with a similar principle, except that it harnesses natural hot air in a blimp-like protrusion. 

Communication: When a sidium cap is formed (typiclly extruded from the obsidian itself), the tube becomes an electrostatic communication device capable to reaching Jupiter. Atop will be a **rod of silver**, and below a huge **silver chain** depends. This acts like a Leyden jar. Touching anything in this state will:

* Make one's hair all stand on end  
* Increase vulnerability to possession and curses  
* Imbue carried conductive metals (not including titanium) with a shock ability

# **\!Silver Mine** {#!silver-mine}

Another half mile from the waterfall, in pitch darkness, is a huge, 30 meter diameter tube leading straight down to an unknown depth: A transport tube for Jovians, but also the silver mine Thormodsdalur (the valley of Thormud) which the vikings worked, as you can see the silver right in the pit's sheerly cut walls. Limited light will not reveal the entire thing initially.

- **The Pit** \- [PIC](https://blogs-images.forbes.com/startswithabang/files/2018/05/PD-of-mammoth-cave.jpg); The ceiling is at least 40 feet above, in this natural cave of rock and permafrost. Leaping down the pit one will eventually get blown back up by fierce hot winds, or simply die. The air "thickens" as you descend. Your ears pop from the pressure, almost certainly deafening you temporarily. If you have a properly equipped magnetic craft, you can descend at a controlled rate using the Lenz effect (magnets fall slower in a magnetic tube). Jumping into the pit you will reach the earth's center in 26 hours (at a terminal velocity of 150 mph) or you can "dive" and halve that time but suffer second degree burns. If the players do this, maybe they arrive at Easter Island and the sub gets to them in 60 days.  
- **Capstan** \- Used by the vikings to lower individuals as far as possible to pick gems from the walls. Intact iron base missing the cross beams. Nearby, a huge pile of dessicated gut rope, and an inset coffin with picks, pitons, horse harnesses, clay oil lamps and a still full oil jar.  
- **Capstan Holes** \- around the pit are various holes dug for the capstan, to get access to all sides of the pit. Some are in the mine passages as well.  
- **Distant Light** \- at some point an orange light will be revealed far far down the pit. Something has stopped obscuring it, and it is the mantle's magma, excluded by but shining through the sidium, visible below.  
- **Inset Coffins** \- built into the stone are coffin-sized spaces with iron lids and leather gadgets masked as stone. They exist both up top, and down within the mines. For hiding in, from the bees and vesperna. Some smell of urine. Some have dust from rotted food. Those up top have a sealable communication tube. It is noticeable that they close quietly and seal well.  
- **Entrance cutting** \- A dangerous cut into the edge leads to rolling gravel which will send you over the edge unless you roll difficulty 5\.  
- **Obsidian Lining** \- 100' down the pit the shape becomes perfectly circular, and is lined with Sidium. See Leyden Tubes for details.  
- **Leyden Chain** \- Not visible until the Ruins Tower lever is pulled, the top of the obsidian-lined shaft will close to form a Leyden Cap. See Leyden Tubes for details.

### The Incut Shafts {#the-incut-shafts}

- **Shafts** \- Winding shafts, all with a singular entry point. Contain various artifacts, inset coffins, a few human skeletons, and some silver tailings. Branches up and down with one side ever open to the pit.  
- **First Mate** \- lost in the shafts, hiding in the Inset Coffins. Tells that his Captain was carried away by bat men, while he hid in a coffin. He feels shamed, though there was little he could have done.  
- **Silver Ore** \- Untapped silver ore is obvious on the walls, but difficult to reach. Some veins, clearly tapped already by the vikings, have left holes up to 6' tall and 12' deep in the wall.  
- **Uranite** \- [PIC](https://i.imgur.com/BOQDEJO.png), [pic](http://img2.reactor.cc/pics/post/%D0%92%D1%81%D1%91-%D1%81%D0%B0%D0%BC%D0%BE%D0%B5-%D0%B8%D0%BD%D1%82%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%B5%D1%81%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%B5-%D1%84%D1%8D%D0%BD%D0%B4%D0%BE%D0%BC%D1%8B-%D0%BA%D0%B0%D0%BC%D0%BD%D0%B8-%D0%BC%D0%B8%D0%BD%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%BB%D1%8B-3680279.jpeg) the very bottom of the shafts one will find glowing, green, ore in the walls. It appears some removal has been attempted, there are smashed bits, but otherwise it is intact. You must mine around it, and use green vitriol to melt it into concentrated uranium. Enough for the equivalent of one sub reactor module, or one guardian helm power supply.  
- **Skeletons** \- can be seen lodged a little way down, and a bit farther down; found here of Toravis andromorphs (bird-men) [details](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ml4MhMjmapNTFYD-ifeZb_XncwotmAcRF9zSmtC7zb0/edit#bookmark=id.u1qmwnnf8c3w). You can find one in a hollowed silver vein large enough for a human to stand in.

### The Ice Veil {#the-ice-veil}

- **Ice Veil** \- A low, barely perceptible hum emanates from a wall of ice. Break through to find the Ruins. Written on stone above the ice veil is *"Nearly all men can stand adversity, but if you want to test a man’s character, give him power".* Also, on the stony ground beside the veil is the Kingittorsuaq Runestone (see below).  
- **Hazards**  
  - Rolling off the entrance cut into the pit  
  - Slipping or toppling of the railingless mined cuts  
  - Dropping into a descending mine shaft  
  - Collapse if you dig in the wrong place

After hearing Penny's translation of the Cult of Purity, they may figure out to shine Ooron on the two blank books (of Faith and of Cleansing by Filth). Hearing those begins a severe bout of bad luck. If they don't leave the sub it will almost certainly sink. If they do, they will encounter Orca on the row to shore, who will attempt to swamp the boat, or ride waves in to grab ankles as the longboats are pulled into shore.

## Madness {#madness}

Bringing ordinary men into the Ruins puts them at risk. Any hostile move will cause the dark, entrapped spirits in the sphere to emerge and possess or curse average men.Troops almost certainly fight each other, the players, and exhibit different forms of madness. Bolton can protect, with command, his tier worth of men.

Some men who go mad shout "Ahlayha\!" and plunge a dagger into a PC.

### The Melting {#the-melting}

After all the bad luck of reading the two blank books, leaving the sub before it melted down, and the orca attacks, the viking hut burned down around them.

The vesperna show up, leading them to Cabot. As his casket melts they lick it, caress it, and then lick him clean when he emerges.

Cabot is frightened, and will take a sword or pistol and threaten. Who are you, where is my crew?

The Vesperna will become ever more insistent on bringing anyone who isn't Spirit Master or Changer onto a pedastal, and calling in the Spider Surgeon to work on them. It will tend to get stuck in the door, as it is the size of five men.

The neck slicing twitch. The dead, putrescent flesh of it, roll or vomit.

The thumb print activation of the caskets, much like activating a tablet.

# **\!Isturn Ruins** {#!isturn-ruins}

## Overview {#overview}

[PIC](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/a9/76/50/a976500f5d97a276c985ff2e42ff1f89.jpg) exterior  
[PIC](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/37/4b/ed/374bedeb55a69d39285bca112fc9308a.png) interior  
Ruins of the ice tower Isturn can be found behind the ice veil beside the pit. Much of the remaining interior is frozen solid, requiring very serious digging to excavate.

Everything is entombed in ice. Barely glimpsed by flickering candles through that ice are mysterious Jovian artifacts of the Ionians. However, warming anything causes both the ice and contents to melt rather than be freed from the ice.

If the vesperna are present, they will gladly show off the freaky half-changed fetus to Henton, who they consider a spirit master. They continue to fear Lucius as a Changer \- one who can warp and morph them.

**Backstory** \- Orophagian Masters mix the human spirit with the spirit of the animal, creating an abomination, while the Changer painfully merges and morphs the two bodies together. Even after completion, the Changer can re-morph the victim many times, always painfully.

## Bottom Floor {#bottom-floor}

[PIC](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/37/4b/ed/374bedeb55a69d39285bca112fc9308a.png) interior

The sphere room is in the center. The surgery, vat, living and sleeping areas branch off n, s, e, and w. Circular rooms 20' around  
**Nitre** \- [PIC](https://thumbs.dreamstime.com/b/potassium-nitrate-ancient-wall-saltpetre-problem-over-old-brick-affected-efflorescence-149604735.jpg) The walls are covered in a white substance. Nitre indicates spirits have been present, in force, in the past.

### Sphere Room {#sphere-room}

Beside the four doors to the rooms below, there are

- **Spiral Stair** **to Tower** \- from above you can hear a buzzing, droning hum.  
- **Vertical shaft to Tower** \- leads to where the Vesperna are, wide enough for them to fly down.

**Contents**

* **Sphere (aka the sphaera)** \- The remains of the sphere shown in the interior picture. Four dragon-like heads [PIC](https://cdn.prod.www.spiegel.de/images/54a13338-0001-0004-0000-000000162617_w1528_r0.9333585762968573_fpx54.97_fpy42.jpg), one broken and one snow-covered, look up at the framework of a sphere. Shards of animal spirits reside in the sphere. Reality discipline shows it to be a complete infrastructure of a sphere. 23 symbols, with 173 different "arm" variations that all point to each other, 11 of the 23 symbols are visible in the material world. 37 of the 173 arm variations won't stay written if one transcribes them.  
  * The sphere, seen with Reality Discipline, reveals that parts of it extends into the Ether.  
  * It is etched with **Icelandic Runes** [PIC](https://symbolsarchive.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Vegvisir-300x300.jpg) (similar to the real life [vegvisir](https://symbolsarchive.com/vegvisir-symbol-history-and-meaning/)) that keep the spirits contained.  
  * Anyone sensitive to spirits, or a spirit that enters the sphere, feels an overwhelming sense of abomination.  
  * Putting any body part into the sphere makes a regular person's hair stand on end. For those sensitive it is a cacophony like a tornado. Shouting will not help until you withdraw.  
* Huge, partially melted candles stand, unlit, at the four corners below the sphere.   
* A smoldering touchwood felt stands in a brass stand beside one. [Link](https://www.history.com/news/10-things-you-may-not-know-about-the-vikings#:~:text=3.,into%20something%20akin%20to%20felt.)  
* Etched into the floor is strange art: [PIC](https://i0.wp.com/imaginarapanui.com/en/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Tangata-Manu-Easter-Island-symbols-Rapa-Nui.jpg?resize=610%2C408&ssl=1)  
* Lighting the candles produces enough light that the tattoos on the vesperna may be discerned. Some icelandic [PIC](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcTNCdqUIShXiWjbme-xeq7mjT5r5hgDi6eGPT3oQBKlwblxEF77pxjPDBM35ZKqYFX9ky8&usqp=CAU) (similar to th, and others relatively "modern" london [PIC](https://i.imgur.com/OrRMOfa.jpeg).

### Living Area {#living-area}

* A room with a crude wooden table. Three desiccated skeletons lie here, with the remains of partially rotted leather clothing and tools. The skeletons show clear blunt and edged trauma. Their weapons have rusted away.  
* A shelf sports six mica-like tablets, but none will activate.  
* Also on the shelf are Cabot's Goldoni Glasses. See [Cabot](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ml4MhMjmapNTFYD-ifeZb_XncwotmAcRF9zSmtC7zb0/edit#bookmark=kix.xcf307kdq6u0).

### Sleeping Quarters {#sleeping-quarters}

* A barracks-like room with crude wooden beds, empty and dust covered.  
* There is a great deal of a melted, morphed, twisted substance here which the players can discover is wax.  
* Preserved deep under the wax are various viking weapons: a sword [PIC](http://kpbs-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com/img/photos/2012/10/09/NOVA_SOVS_ulfberht.jpg), a knife [PIC](https://cdna.artstation.com/p/marketplace/presentation_assets/001/329/468/large/file.jpg?1635589995), a wooden shield [PIC](https://media.istockphoto.com/photos/old-viking-shield-isolated-on-white-3d-render-picture-id1253799648), and a viking helmet [PIC](https://i.imgur.com/QUHtpha.jpg), lined with gold, that gives a \+1 resistance against mental assault. The helm has Icelandic glyphs minutely etched into the gold. Eleven such, with 37 spoke variants.

### Surgery Room {#surgery-room}

* **Spider Surgeon** [link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ml4MhMjmapNTFYD-ifeZb_XncwotmAcRF9zSmtC7zb0/edit#bookmark=id.yf1valnu6x3u)\- A smashed, organic looking surgery table, resembling that of the Zayans, but somehow very different. More organic, spider-like, with many obsidian scalpels and injection arms. The surgery table was purely for genetic changes, but is now non-functional. However, if attacked, the putrescent spider surgeon can break free of the table and run amok.   
* Remains of rusted human implements, degraded cloths, and the **uniform of the whaler captain** can be found here. Despite this, the table appears long unused.  
* Seemingly discarded in a corner is a torso and wax-like melted face, all made of wax: [PIC](https://cdna.artstation.com/p/assets/images/images/047/867/122/large/natalia-maschera-di-cera.jpg?1648637402)  
* Searching within or around the wax face one will find the Scroll of Changing [DEETS](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LqiRNtbNNFHiwTlTtDOvNcbd44cmWiaR0uA1-sod398/edit#bookmark=id.bz8jk6tt4j1o).

### Vat Room {#vat-room}

There are 13 caskets in this room, in various states.

Above the door to this room is this picture, which appears to have been added by hand using the char from a burnt stick: [PIC](https://www.bradshawfoundation.com/easter/birdman/birdman2b.gif)

* **8 Caskets** \- A few caskets covered in smashed ice. One has a pile of dried bloody residue in the bottom.  
* **2 Broken Caskets** \- A large, human sized vat with mica crystal sides and black fungus growing upon it. Unclear what used to be inside, but it appears a liquid.  
* **Zocto Vat** \- [PIC](https://images-cdn.9gag.com/photo/aAeb9Mg_700b.jpg) this inert shape in perfectly clear ice.  
* **Captain Vat** \- one vat is filled with milky white, showing a man-sized fetal shape within. The hands, feet are bound with leather. The face: [PIC](https://cdnb.artstation.com/p/assets/images/images/019/814/677/large/lokkende-frozen-face.jpg?1565117076) except red wax covers the eyes. The American captain, a member of the cult of Purity, is inside. If revived he will sabotage the mission in subtle ways. Ahlayha\!  
* **Cabot Vat** \- [PIC](http://mrbelloblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/john-cabot.jpg) [details](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ml4MhMjmapNTFYD-ifeZb_XncwotmAcRF9zSmtC7zb0/edit#bookmark=id.bpfpxgxfvk6q) \- Within a clear casket, entombed in blue ice, lies John Cabot. He can be thawed carefully, with medical attention. He will gradually, over three months, andromorph into a Vesperna, losing his mind and ultimately his power of speech. He will recognize Vesperna tattoos as those of his men. **Penny** will know of his voyages. **Bolton** and **Beard** will note the coincidences of his name to the Cabot Strait.

## Ice Tower {#ice-tower}

Up a long, spiral stair is the ice-bound tower room. It appears to have been a lookout, but all it sees now is glacial ice. There are two exit doors. Outside it on one side are the vesperna nests, and on the other is the cerulean hive.

* **Lever \-** a large lever sits in the middle of the tower on this floor. Pulling it causes ancient machinery to grind. The window *would* look over the "bottomless" mine shaft, but now all you can see is vague movement. It causes  
* **Book** \- A book, blank, entombed in wax can be found here. It is similar to the blank book found in Kumasi.  
* **Vesperna Nests (left side)** \- [DEETS](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ml4MhMjmapNTFYD-ifeZb_XncwotmAcRF9zSmtC7zb0/edit#bookmark=id.yerq8fs0q6j) Above a lookout platform here, hanging from the ceiling 20 feet up by their talons, are 30 of the man bats called Vesperna, their feces cluttering the platform.  
* **Cerulean Bee Hive (right side)** \-  [PIC](https://previews.123rf.com/images/backiris/backiris1907/backiris190700138/128743104-closeup-huge-beehive-of-giant-honey-bees-on-a-branch.jpg), [DEETS](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ml4MhMjmapNTFYD-ifeZb_XncwotmAcRF9zSmtC7zb0/edit#bookmark=id.mus4203rbfpy) At the top is an enormous, 10' diameter, hive of **blue bees**. They are mostly quiescent, emitting a low thrumming that rattles the teeth. Warming them will cause them to attack the players to create skin monsters.

### Exploration {#exploration}

- **DONE Lighting** \- Arkwright will arrive with a Sir Humphry Davy carbon arc lamp (invented 1809\) This lamp [PIC](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/da/Arc_light_and_battery.jpg/1024px-Arc_light_and_battery.jpg) is very bright, just barely reaching across the pit, and able to illuminate glints of silver ore embedded in the pit walls as well as skeletons. It is powered by an early battery which drains very quickly. Arkwright will fill it with sea water as the catalyst. After this initial light dies, it can be further explored using Geordie lamps [pic](http://archivesalive.ncl.ac.uk/amazing/wp-content/uploads/stephenson-lamp-768x1277.jpg) and Davey lamps [pic](https://i0.wp.com/ageofrevolution.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Miners-lamp11-681x1024.jpg?fit=1250%2C1000&ssl=1).

### Events {#events}

- **Vesperna** \- the group will hear a distant screech. And more screeches far away. It is the Vesperna [details](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ml4MhMjmapNTFYD-ifeZb_XncwotmAcRF9zSmtC7zb0/edit#bookmark=id.yerq8fs0q6j), rising up, wings wide as they surf the rising pit air. Use the inset coffins to escape them. [SOUND](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppLsu5Z2Np0) (play at 0.25 speed). They will **kidnap** a player or NPC and bring them over the ice veil into the ruins, to the Room of Change. These Vesperna look very old, with deep wrinkles and grey hair.  
  - Some are viking. Some of Cabot's men, with tattoos he may recognize.

# **Vesperna Attack** {#vesperna-attack}

Rip Hendriks, crewman of the American whaler, stole the blue crystal and returned it to the medikaran.

The Vesperna attack Ross's ship, carrying away every sailor except possibly Ross himself.

The taken sailors are found entombed in ice below the plain in front of the Ice Tower. Their spirits are in the sphere. If one is removed, the body still breathes, but there is no mind. One by one they will be physically absorbed into the caskets in the Vat Room. The first 13 are already there.

Vesperna are back up top. Six sailors lie in pools of water before the tower. Thirteen are already frozen in vats. Ross is on the table being worked on by the Medikaran. Lucius has had pinky bitten off, and will suffer Horror within half an hour. Rip Hendricks will attack them at the top of the tower. PCs are with, what, a group of 12 including Parry, Francis.

* 6 men are on 'warmth detail'

Arcane Insight: Make a roll to understand the relationship between these freaky man bats and the wife of Daniel the Menagerist. It is not, after all, impossible that she still lives. But whether she can be saved is unclear.

**Note On Killing**: Each time you kill in this area the spirit of the dead might cling to you, hindering you. Roll a Chaos Resistance DC below or suffer a \-1 cumulative disablement to all magic resistance for four rounds, up to a maximum of \-3. Such spirits can be abjured.

* DC 8 if the killing wasn't to defend a life  
* DC 5 if the killing was self defense against physical or spiritual harm  
* DC 3 if the killing was to save another for harm

### Ice Plain {#ice-plain}

**Entombed:** The plain in front of the tower has six sailors in melted holes in the ice. Liquid trickles in, and the bottom two inches of each sailor is frozen solid. They are awake and staring, but have been deprived somehow of voice. You can chip slowly, in which case it take ten minutes, or fast with a DC 5 effort to break them out. Rolling a 1 means you have broken an arm or leg in the attempt.

Parry, face smashed is climbing up to kill Rip. Rip is 70% gone. Constance is in wax, and Bolton is out, Throckmorton is out. All are in the corridor. Henton is near Parry, as is Gahan, and two sailors are disabled there. Two more sailor are headed to Throckmorton with explosives. Three vesperna still flap near the ceiling, ready to cause trouble to the climbers. If we get to round 10 without interrupting the Ross surgery, then Ross is lost.

At start: Show picture of Rip: [PIC](https://cdna.artstation.com/p/assets/images/images/052/119/412/medium/art-merenfeld-darwin-an-old-man-wearing-a-robe-burning-from-the-inside-glowin-715d5103-ceb2-4c67-a1a5-220b65fc7a7a.jpg?1658994255)

Rolls to see opposing spirits get a bonus of the greater of (intention shield or liberated mind)  
\+1 asset if spirit is already on the job.  
\+0,1,2 for your capability in spirit defenses

### Sphere Room {#sphere-room-1}

**Rip** is found here [PIC](https://cdna.artstation.com/p/assets/images/images/052/119/412/medium/art-merenfeld-darwin-an-old-man-wearing-a-robe-burning-from-the-inside-glowin-715d5103-ceb2-4c67-a1a5-220b65fc7a7a.jpg?1658994255), Tier 6, in the middle of the sphere, swirling spirits all around him visible to anyone. To sneak or hide roll Intention Shield vs DC 6 or he detects your mind. 

* **Degeneration:** Bits and pieces of him are coming loose, swirling around, skeletonizing him. Within ten rounds he will be devoid of flesh, but not yet dead. A thick tendril of inky blackness leads from the sphere to Bram (see below).  
* **Cursing:** He will point at 1d6 \= 1/1/1/2/2/3 targets each round, shouting Ahlayha\! Save vs DC 5 int or be cursed. He can store up to 3 to be released at once which he always does the first round. He can not convey more than one curse per person.  
* He always Ahlayhas and points at three people, so you must decide who is actually the target.  
  * **Detection**: Those who see the unseen roll DC 6 as a free action to know. Roll vs victim tier to "see it in their eyes".   
  * Zealous Madness (DC 6 vs Liberated Mind) \- victim will attack, interfere, or cunningly wait  
  * Cursed (DC 6 vs Body Autonomy) \- dim sight (all is dark beyond 10'), numb hands (drop anything), locked jaw (no talking), trip and slip (DC 6 to move), etc.  
  * **Defense**: Those without the requisite magic defense are simply affected.  
  * A light spirit may intercept/neutralize the incoming shackled spirit, but remains thus engaged until a spirit master DC 6 abjures the spirit (vs curse) or Exorcizes (vs madness). \[curse abjuration round 1 can do 1 at \+0, round 2 can do 2 at \+1, round 3 can do 3 at \+2, but previous rounds must be pur prep\]  
* **Ranged weapons** will be halted and blown aside by the swirling spirits.  
* **Melee weapons** will melt and waver inside the sphere, unusable, though when withdrawn they will appear unaltered.  
* He can simply be pulled down by main strength. Climbing to him requires a boost and cooperative effort, which of course he will interfere with.

If captured he will talk about his long, patient life waiting to cleanse the world, and the honor of having the opportunity to awaken one such as Capt. Bram Van Wooten. He can expose one more Purity Cult member among those rescued, and even recognize those on the ship..

### Surgery Room \- Approach {#surgery-room---approach}

**Wax Trap:** Outside the room, in a long 20' corridor with a low 5' ceiling, is a pile of wax. Stepping into it, it will start hard and suddenly soften, trapping the legs. It feels as if hands are writhing within the wax, grasping you. Faces seem to melt and appear across the surface.

* **Detecting**: You can hear Van Wooten within, ordering the wax in Old Norse. DC 4 to detect what language, DC 6 to understand the commands.  
* **Jump**: You can jump over, DC 8 might, with your roll representing how far you got. DC+1 per person already trapped within the wax.  
* **Break Out**: Strength DC 8 to break out. Heating the wax you can decrease the DC by 1/2/3 by applying heat damaging your dex by 1/3/5  
* **Spotting**: Roll DC 4 to spot a crystal, and DC 4 again to pick it out. See *Suborning* below.  
* **Ordering**: One with "spiritual authority" or "authority to command" can order the wax using Old Norse words such as  Melt=**mýkjask**, Grab=**þrífa**, Release=**Taka**, Defend=**verja,** Harden=**herða**, Climb=**hlaupa**. [English to Old Norse Translation](https://www.vikingsofbjornstad.com/Old_Norse_Dictionary_E2N.shtm)  
* **Suborning**: There are six spirits within the wax, wanting to be the shape of men. A few small golem crystals swirl within. You can exorcize the spirits, entice and tether them, or pick out crystals, each one easing DC vs the golem mass by 1 to a minimum of DC 2 and also capping how many people can be trapped to 2\*numSpirits.

### Surgery Room \- Inside {#surgery-room---inside}

*By flickering lamp light you see the strange, bulky, spider-like entity hovering over a long, man-sized table. Its skin is thin, dangling, rotting meat. Skeletal arms with bits of flesh, some tipped with obsidian, some moving like knitting needles, move with great speed and certainty, working at whatever is on the table.* 

*Upon the table a strange lump, too misshapen to be a man, quivers. It is Captain Ross. Standing beside, with his hand on Ross's forehead as if in benediction, stands a goat-headed man* [PIC](https://cdnb.artstation.com/p/assets/images/images/021/159/441/large/pepunka-artist-pepunka-artist-goat-1.jpg?1570615570) *draped in a cloak reminiscent of priest's robes. His hand bears an American captain's tattoo [PIC](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/cf/44/bf/cf44bf34afff278852e3286555aff3f6.jpg). His robe swims strangely in your vision, and upon it, a paragraph of strange characters faintly glow. [Link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1AcR0hSnRSfYmagA84TgAdJINSm2I7nzjTof4tgHyZL4/edit#bookmark=id.nckmmobutb6f) \[roll decipher to get a few starter letters\] He speaks in a mumbling, goat-like bleat.*

*The hulking spider thing has ten arms touching, grasping, or within Ross's dissected frame, and you realize his ribs have been cracked open and spread like the wings of an eagle. The goat man bleats. Ross shrieks, and gasps out "They are using me... to corrupt the men. Erebus fights Terror."*

*Wax golems ooze in the corridor, slowly moving into the room. The strange goat-headed man tosses an orange crystal [PIC](https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-9eoaOfYGYb8/WdKBMKRsblI/AAAAAAAANlM/dV6rkgiA3cs5nYXPEshYypKOaQKy_7F2gCLcBGAs/s1600/Orpiment%2Bfrom%2BTwin%2BCreeks%2Bmine%252C%2BHumboldt%2BCo.%252C%2BNevada.jpg) into a vat of what appears to be acid. Other crystals are already there. There is an orange fume in the room.*

*The goat-headed man makes clear: "I haaave your meeeen under myyy pooower, and thiiiis one.", he gestures to Ross. "Leeeet us speeeeak" He bleats an order. The spider thing stops its motion, obsidian blades at Ross's throat.* 

If you advance, Ross dies and (he claims) the men in the vat room die (but they won't). If you let him walk out, Ross lives.

**Rolls:**

* **DC 4** to realize that deaths in this area will be captured into the sphere, for use making abominations.  
* **DC 3** to understand the crystals are Arsenic, and the vat is acid producing gas. Roll **DC 3** to know it magnifies bad luck, and gives everyone a hindrance against dark spirits.  
* **DC 7** arcana to understand the basic function of the robe (see unseen is asset).  
* **DC 5** to spot the blue crystal in the medikaran  
* **See the Unseen** **DC 3** to perceive dark tendrils from Ross's ribs heading towards the ships.

Bram, the spirit master, by dissecting and torturing Captain Ross, takes advantage of the spiritual connection between the captain and his men. It is using him to incite riot and mayhem on the ships. When the players return, Ross's men will have fought Perry's men gruesomely and many if not all will be dead.

**The Medikaran** (tier 6, health 18\) is patched up (by its own hand) but not looking very good. The large golem crystal is obvious within it, and the covering of skin is weak. It can fend off up to 10 attacks vs itself or Bram, shatter its own limb each time to do so.

* **Grab the crystal** to disable it.  
* It uses DNA-altering knitting needles

**Captain Bram Van Wooten, Shaman**  
Tier 7, Health 30  
Captain of the American whaler, Bram is a [Shaman](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ml4MhMjmapNTFYD-ifeZb_XncwotmAcRF9zSmtC7zb0/edit#bookmark=kix.ieczd1gk73et) tier Spirit Master in the Cult of Purity.

**Visions:** While the party considers they are plunged into the visions described below. When they wake the goat-headed man is gone.

**Negotiation**: Bram will negotiate. He wants to leave alive, but mostly his work here is done. Throckmorton may tend to Ross now, and while that happens he wants to convince:

* Henton *"You see so much more than these paltry creatures of matter. If you only knew the power of Purity. Why must out spirits be caged within the bonds of weak, disgusting flesh? Join me. We can set every spirit free of its mortal coil, as it was meant to be\!"*  
* Constance *"Why do you hold back your power? It is wasted among the unappreciated, and your source of authority will soon be under the sway of the Lord Sublime. My master offers certainty. Every kill moves humanity one step closer to perfection, to cleansing, to Purity."*  
* Lucius *"Now you know there is no god. Your pope is nothing but a puppet. He worships Purity, yet he is the least among us, no better than a dog. Why do you labor? Take up the Lord Sublime. Put his yoke upon you and learn from him, for he is gentle and humble in heart, and you will find rest for your soul."*

Has transformed to a goat head man [PIC](https://cdnb.artstation.com/p/assets/images/images/021/159/441/large/pepunka-artist-pepunka-artist-goat-1.jpg?1570615570).

Gahan and Constance are at end of corridor. Bram is near them, and one living unharmed vesperna. All others are in surgery room. Ross is throat cut (dead).

* Henton is about to see souls from the ships rushing towards the sphere, and Ross's as well, and all the dead Vesperna.  
* Tuktu and the Trouble Makers will arrive, having heard the ruckus and seen the vesperna carrying men from the Erebus and Terror, but NOT aware of the subsequent fighting. Tuktu needs to see the sphere for later activities.

Tactics:

* If immediately attacked he will Bleat or use On Your Knees.  
* He will explain that Amber disrupts spirits, putting the PCs in bad luck  
* Then negotiate (as above)  
* He then plunges PCs into visions

Bram \= 21 \- 10 \- 9 (remember False Death)

**7 spirits per round, used for curses**

**Defenders**: melted wax golems (Tier 4, Health 12, 12, 12, 12, 12, 12, special defenses)

**3 personal actions per round, to different opponents**

**Defenses**

* **2 armor** via the ether cloak as the velocity of the incoming matter is depleted.  
* **\+2 vs Kinetic**: He wears a simple, strange robe (ether weave) which grants DC \+2 vs kinetic energy unattached to a guiding spirit. For example, a human swinging a sword it can not ignore, but an arrow fired from a bow, a following rock, or a bullet will be ignored.   
* **Intercept**: The medikaran will interpose up to 10 limbs to take any incoming physical attacks. The limb will break each time.  
* **Bloodless** \- never bleed or take bleeding damage  
* **False death** \- appears defeated. Regains \+6 health per round in this state

**Weakness**

* Any ability that works on animals will work on him. He does not know this.

**Curses**

* **On your knees**	\- \[ba\] force all within long distance (100') to their knees for 3 rnds  
* **Numb hands**		\- drop whatever you are holding for 2 rnds  
* **Bad luck aura**	\- opponents suffer mishaps on 1-5  
* **Hallucinations**	\- A vision of men on Erebus and Terror madly strangling, gouging eyes, biting each others' faces. Roll DC 7 or suffer 2 hindrances for 3 rounds.

**Attacks**

* **Revelation:** He might explain how Amber can be used to disrupt spirits, causing bad luck to attend all listeners.  
* **Stun**: He can bleat, causing all who hear it to save or be stunned for 1 round and deaf for 3 rounds.  
* **Command**: Using Old Norse he can command any Tier \<=2 mook

**Vision Tsunami**  
The vision of the future arctic, baking in heat, bones of whales, walruses, seals and men bleaching in the sun. Strange buildings, now collapsed and ruined by conflict, stand mournful for their long dead occupants: a lost effort to survive the inevitable heat death of the world. ioan eradicators [PIC](https://i.pinimg.com/736x/2a/58/a8/2a58a89aae97d08394c80580e60224b0.jpg) or [PIC](https://i.pinimg.com/736x/79/de/08/79de0847452088a9f461e735c75861d9.jpg) move across the surface.

* Throck \- Trevithick extolls the beauty of progress as he throws whale bones into a gleaming machine. Cables run to mysterious machines as it belches smoke. But you wouldn't understand Throckmorton old boy. You're not *ready.*  
* Const \- Father Kensington sweats in a heavy netsilik seal caribou coat. He is red-faced, sweating heavily and appears faint. His lips are cracked. Inside the coat are the shades of hundreds of children. He tries to spare them from the sun, but they moan in despair.  
* Gahan \- A dark star presents, him with all the digits of pi, and e, and the square root of two, and the golden ratio. He finds himself speaking the digits in order, forever.  
* Bolton \- Admiral Cockburn berates him about Dinky Derrick, completely unjustly, saying he was negligent, never cared for his men, can't lead, etc. Cockburn chews on whale bones as he speaks, distorting his words.  
* Lucius \- little black coal men from Kumasi "why didn't you save us? You didn't care\!" But they melt like pitch onto the scorching rocks, wide, child-like eyes staring. They gnaw human bones, and their spirits overwhelm him.  
* Henton \- spirits trudge about the barren landscape. Some wail, "How could we have known?", or "I didn't do anything wrong", or "There are other planets, never fear". They all dangle like puppets from a silver spirit thread.

**AFTERMATH \- See Spirit Theft below**

### Living Area {#living-area-1}

No changes, except the Goldoni Glasses are more noticeable.

### Sleeping Quarters {#sleeping-quarters-1}

The strange wax is completely gone, revealing the bones beneath.

### Vat Room {#vat-room-1}

* Thirteen vats are all filled with ice-block sailors.  
* **Deformed Zocto** is out, frozen and seemingly dead on the floor. It will revive if put under high pressure, and can be communicated with

### Tower Top {#tower-top}

The recent absorption of so many souls by the sphaera has weakened the vesperna. They will be found sleeping (hibernating), hanging upside down from the ceiling above the tower's top floor. See Andromorphs for details on fighting and defeating them.

Anyone previously wounded or touched by vesperna must make DC 4+(numTimesTouched=1/2/2/3/3/3) roll or suffer Transformation Horror.

Shards of strange statues litter the top of the tower. They are moai who have tried to eradicate the vesperna but failed. A small moai among the rubble.

# **Conclusion** {#conclusion}

## Spirit Theft

The 133 souls from the Erebus and Terror are seen coming from the ships, sucked into the sphere.

Suddenly Henton feels all his tethered spirits being pulled towards the sphere.

The arcanists realize:

* Roll 3 \- 133 total spirits from the Erebus and Terror, all British citizens to be transformed into abominations or who knows what.  
* Roll 3 \- the spirit of Dinky Derrick must have been sucked into the sphere.  
* Roll 4 \- plus 40 spirits from the American whaler, 200 spirits from Cabot's fleet, as well as uncounted Viking spirits, will all meet the same fate. Perhaps 500 men grand total.  
* Roll 5 \- Henton can send a tethered spirit into the sphere to track it. Preceding hint "if only there were some way of tracking all those spirits"

**Moving the Sphere**: The Vesperna pick up the sphere. Bram pulls a lever (or it just occurs): Special magnets protrude from the six cardinal directions of the sphere. They carry it over the ice veil. They drop it down the pit. Perhaps this [PIC](https://cdnb.artstation.com/p/assets/images/images/024/637/441/large/chandan-ojha-worm.jpg?1583069600) catches it

**Water Entrance**: The players discover a gravity membrane in the wall of the pit, perfectly curved. Behind it is water and a big tube large enough for their submarine.

**Uranite**: If it hasn't all been mined, someone may recall the Uranite deposit. Quite useful for powering the sub, or the Guide helmet.

On Bram they find:

* **Opium** \- A big ol' stash of opium, suitable for smoking.  
* **Spirit Key** [PIC](https://i.imgur.com/2avg2xg.jpeg) \- a golden key, imbued with Ether, that looks like it will open up or unlock or destroy the sphere and free the souls.  
* **Diary** [PIC](https://i.etsystatic.com/23070332/r/il/c513a1/2665470901/il_794xN.2665470901_53by.jpg) \- On Bram's body is a small personal diary: *"We have arrived at the Place of Glacial Night. My crew, except those loyal to Purity, are unaware. By sublime twists my orders were misinterpreted and the ship has been successfully entrapped in the ice. There is no escape, and even as I write this I can hear the pressure of the ice splintering of the hull. These many deaths shall feed well the Masters, who will abominate their souls. Soon I go to join them. What will I find? Will my 32 years of study and patience be rewarded? Faith, I counsel myself. Faith. \- Bram Van Wooten, Captain, Springing Goat"* He intentionally caused his ship to be crushed in ice, trapping all his men to use them as fodder for the sphere.

## Returning to the Submersible

When they return to the sub, they discover:

1. **Survivor** \- A lone man, and American from the whaler named Don Waters, has survived the Erebus/Terror madness. Secret: He is a member of the Cult of Purity.  
2. **Rotten Food** \- All of the food on the players' submersible, and all the food on the Erebus and Terror, has suddenly and mysteriously gone rotten. They must visit the Netsilik to restock, and to learn:  
   1. Maybe the location of the submerged entrance to the shaft's water tube.  
   2. Or, malamutes can mush the sub up onto the glacier, where they can break through.  
3. **Logbook** \- Beard has found a secret compartment in the captain's cabin. It has a **Captain's Logbook** [PIC](https://i.etsystatic.com/5393636/r/il/104c28/1296153657/il_794xN.1296153657_e9cg.jpg) describing  
* The finding of the sub (based on strange messages from an unknown source)  
* Failure at the Battle of Trafalgar due to impossible controls  
* Stripping the sub of weird controls and replacing them  
* Service in the Bonapartist forces moving spies  
* The rescue of Napoleon from Elba  
* And then nothing (the sub was sabotaged by Lady Margaret, eventually captured, and renovated for years by the British)  
4. **Hidden Controls** \- Arkwright has discovered **hidden controls**. What was mistaken for a mapping station spins on an axis and reveals a series of levers, dials, and switches not meant for human hands. He has been reluctant to touch them without Captain's orders.

# **Artifacts** {#artifacts}

Found in the ruins, on

* **Etched Map** \- a map of the many air tubes running through the earth (but not the water tubes)  
* **Kingittorsuaq Runestone** \- [PIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingittorsuaq_Runestone#/media/File:Runesten_fra_Kingittorsuaq.jpg) \- From about 1300 *"Erlingur the son of Sigvat and Bjarni Þorðar's son and Eindriði Oddr's son, the washingday (Saturday) before Rogation Day, dug these tunnels and mined"*
