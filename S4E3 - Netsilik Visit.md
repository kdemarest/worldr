Ross and Parry will escort the group to meet Tuktu's tribe of [Netsilik Inuit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netsilik_Inuit). They will bring the players on a hunt for seal, whale, fish and bird eggs to replenish ship's stores. When up high, they will see the morning stars, and the little ice pyramid of Krava Kakivak.

* Inuit means "people" and Eskimo means "eaters of meat"

The netsilik are the tribe of Tuktu, who simply call themselves "Netsilik" or "people of the seal". They are about 24 adults strong, surviving in the icy wastes by teamwork and hunting. They are to be found near modern day Pituffik in an area called Kitikmeot. The netsilik language is Natsilingmiutut [LINK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natsilingmiutut).

## Culture & Magic {#culture-&-magic}

[gallery](https://allthatsinteresting.com/inuit-people)  
All goods are shared. Anything brought into the camp might be assumed to be available to any adult. Since all food in shared, asking for food is considered offensive. If you want food, it is already yours.

## Day 0 \- Prelude {#day-0---prelude}

*Supplies have been getting short. As you sail north unseasonably cold winds blow. The temperature drops to 15 degrees Fahrenheit (about 25 degrees colder than usual). Within the day snow is falling, and sea ice is seen forming.*  
   
*Upon approaching the bay in which the tribe camps, it has been freezing for several days. The Netsilik inlet is frozen, and the only way forward is under the ice by submersible. It is time to say goodbye to captains Ross and Parry.*

## Day 1 \- Arrival {#day-1---arrival}

*As you travel across the blinding white snow, ahead you can see several large mounds. A few people stand or sit, dressed in voluminous one-piece seal skin clothing. Children throw rocks at a standing piece of driftwood. A distant, solitary man, dragging something large, is approaching the little village. Ahead, two women haul fresh summer moss on their backs. [PIC](https://allthatsinteresting.com/inuit-people#17)*

Note: Infanticide (and geriatricide) is common among the Netsilik due to the fact that too many children will make the tribe unable to feed itself. Pragmatism leads to a preference for male children, and the utility of male hunters, means that most Netsilik at 1/3 female and 2/3 male. [*deets*](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2799344)

### Meeting {#meeting}

*A little girl, wrapped in her warm parka and bearing a malamute puppy, runs up to you and stares. [PIC](https://i.imgur.com/EK2Xn.jpg)  The hunter walks by dragging the fresh carcass of a seal. He stares at you as well. Nearby, a malamute the size of a small pony looks on, curious but not alarmed. [PIC](https://img.freepik.com/premium-photo/young-beatiful-alaskan-malamute-lying-snow-dog-winter_277459-672.jpg?w=2000) It has small booties of some kind of leather on its paws. People emerge from the snow domes to help the hunter cut up the seal. It seems like everyone has come to help, and perhaps to gawk at the white skinned newcomers. You hear the word "Qallunaat" spoken frequently.*

\[Anyone with spirit sight:\] *Small, faded spirits rest sleeping upon the snow here. They are not cold. You sense that they never lived past their first day.* 

You meet the head woman Kabloka [PIC](https://www.thevintagenews.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/65/2017/01/699px-Kabloka_Netsilik-inuit_7602228786-497x640.jpg), Kumaglak the best hunter [PIC](http://www.artnet.com/WebServices/images/ll00087lldtZCGFgOjECfDrCWvaHBOcuPt/lomen-brothers-inuit-man.jpg), and Tuktu's wife Tanaraq [PIC](http://PIC). Tanaraq shows you to your own illuvigak, which has sleeping space for ten.

*A netsilik woman comes into the illuvigak. Her smile is broad and infectious. She winks at you as she offers a cup carved of walrus tusk. "Utjuk\!" she says. It is difficult, in the dim light of the illuvigak, to see exactly what is in the cup, but you are clearly expected to take a sip. "This is Qimmiq," says Tanaraq, "She will cook for you, keep your sleeping place, help with garments and serve your needs. Her Angutik (husband) fell through the ice. She needs a new Angutik."*

Anyone who takes a sip tastes the iron tang and feels immediate warmth flood their body. It is seal's blood, considered critical to warmth and strength. It is fresh from Kumaglak's kill.

### Purge

* Meriwa purges anyone bitten by the Vesperna of any disease, using a combination of seal spleen, whale brain, and a string figure: Withdraw Disease: [PIC](https://i.imgur.com/BYWoSmC.png)

### Last Kayak {#last-kayak}

* Sent for driftwood by Nootaikok the kayak maker.  
* Who will find the all-important keel strip (highest d20 survival roll)?  
* See the kayak maker use the bow drill [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKbwNdes0SY&t=2m50s)  
* Boil seal oil to soften the wood, then bend it into shape  
* Place the keel string, and the sitting place  
* Only a woman can cover it with skin, for a woman is skillful with a needle  
* Skins are brought from where they soak in the ocean  
* Completion [vid](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKbwNdes0SY&t=12m44s)  
* Gather summer moss to put in your boots, to ease your weary feet as you travel

### Evening Welcome {#evening-welcome}

* You are welcomed to sit, take off your boots and warm your toes by the fire  
* Drum playing and dancing welcome the visitors from afar. [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFX7or7Vek8&t=11m15s)  
* Girls make cat's cradles in the corner. Sometimes they race, or practice being synchronized. Sometimes one takes it from another, each adding a step until a pattern is made: Cat's cradle, witches broom, etc.  
* A young man attempts to juggle  
* *A woman shouts "Ujuk\! Ujuk\!" and men walk towards the large illuvigak. The smell of dinner wafts across the snow. When you gather, the tribe sings a song to Sedna the Sea Goddess in thanks for the harvest of seal.*  
* **Food:** It is boiled seal seasoned with fireweed, raw fish, cloudberry, and frozen egg. You are handed an ulu, and expected to cut an appropriate portion of meat after you have grabbed it with your teeth, like so: [pic](https://allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/inuit-people-ulu.jpg).  
* You are advised that you all must help hunt. The tribe lacks men to gather all you need. *Tomorrow, says Tuktu, all must hunt, for the tribe has not so many men that we may grant food freely and not fear starvation in the winter. Meriwa will tell you the most important story for success in your hunt. But later. Now we make trials of strength, so that we may know if the strength of your arm is right for the hunt\!*  
* Trials of Strength [deets](#bookmark=id.lo78h82hq69i)  
* Meriwa recognizes Henton and Lucius as having "helping spirits" that they can call up to give them assistance.  
* Story Time: Meriwa appears in full shamanic garb [PIC](https://boodijewellery.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/inuit-woman-tattoo.jpg). She tells the story "Honor of Hunters" [story](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YK5SUOF44U&t=2m57s) (time 2:40) 

### Sleeping {#sleeping}

*Carrying oil lamps beneath the star spangled sky, you return to your illuvigak. Your bellies are full, the night is crisp, and your polar bear robes are warm. The illuvigak glows with an oil lamp from within, and Qimmiq welcomes you with a smile. The bed is comforting in the cold arctic night, and the interior of the illuvigak is a cozy 58 degrees.*

* **Chewed Boots** \- A sled dog has snuck into the illuvigak and chewed someone's boots. Qimmiq will take them with a smile and a seeming promise that all will be well.

*Qimmiq sits in the lamplight with a bone needle, stitching boots. She hums a quiet tune. She look peaceful, in her element, a vision of a simpler life. The comforting rhythms of her voice lull you to a deep sleep. Some of you dream.*

* After working a while Qimmiq will snuggle in with whomever has been kind to her. She is warm, and does not snore.

**Dreams** that night, each hearing the words of the goat-headed man:

* Henton		*"We can set every spirit free of its mortal coil, as it was meant to be\!"*  
* Constance	*"...your source of authority will soon be under the sway of the Lord Sublime..."*  
* Lucius		*"...Your pope is nothing but a puppet... yet he is the least among us, no better than a dog."*  
* One Other	dreams of great black spiky shapes, and opening one, and having a clawed hand reach out and grasp him by the tongue  
* All Others	dream of success in a hunt

## Day 2 \- Hunt {#day-2---hunt}

You are woken before the rising of the sun. A breakfast of cooked eggs and raw salmon awaits.

### To The Hunt {#to-the-hunt}

On the way to the hunt, Kumaglak tells the story of the Origin of Men: [story](https://www.sacred-texts.com/nam/inu/eft/eft06.htm). He finds it absurd. Who could become so powerful in the ways of evil? He has never met such a man.

* See the Morning Stars

### Evening Congress {#evening-congress}

* As before a woman shouts "Ujuk" and everyone gathers  
* The leader of the PCs is offered Nukilik as a wife. She is strong but not clever with her hands. The tribe worries she will not pull her own weight with a needle.  
* Tuktu asks whether his people can ask you Qallunaat questions, and he can translate. If the assent is given, these questions come out:  
  * Do all of your women hunt?  
  * May I see your ancestor amulet? (all Netsilik have this as a charm against bad luck)  
  * Does the sun really shine every day where you are from?  
  * Is it true there are stone tents the height of sixty men? (St Pauls in 360' tall)  
  * I hear the women wear clothing of many colors, like the flowers of the summer fields  
  * What do you eat for breakfast? What do you mean, farming? What is that?  
  * We are grateful that your ships sink, for they bring us flat driftwood.  
  * Where do you find the iron? It has changed our lives, for now we can saw.  
* Two sailors bicker over the affections of a native girl nicknamed Greenstockings [PIC](https://farm6.static.flickr.com/5258/5447939115_3c30c0bf19_b.jpg). They attempt to fight a duel, but Beard pisses in the gunpowder for their weapons, resulting in misfires on all sides.  
* Meriwa again appears, this time to tell the spooky story of the Tupilak: [Story](https://www.sacred-texts.com/nam/inu/eft/eft07.htm)

Constance slipped below the ice hole, saved by Thorckmorton. She is limited to 1/4 on all stats. While 200' down searching for Constance's lost guns and knives Throck saw the Ice Sigils. Henton is protective of Constance, kept in the main room to "be around friendly souls". Lucius used a Cypher to restore Constance's points. That will have some positive influence on her recovery. Throck should think about the Tupilak story.

* String figures are made, and shared, and any PC who participates can feel the power.  
* More Dreams  
  * similar to the first night  
  * some from the future at Syzygy are dreamt.

## Day 3 \- Hunt {#day-3---hunt}

* See the Morning Stars

### The Hunt

* On the way to the hunt you hear about the boy from the sea: [story](https://www.sacred-texts.com/nam/inu/eft/eft17.htm)  
* See the **ice zigurrat** [link](#bookmark=id.ch7u66vxhst4) and meet **Krava Kakivak** [link](#bookmark=id.v0zff9o2ond2)  
* During the return trip from the hunt it becomes colder still, and snow begins to fall in a blizzard. You become a bit lost and suddenly the snow clears and you see the **Morning Stars** [link](#bookmark=id.o1b1p3jizol5)

### Evening Stories {#evening-stories}

* Qimmiq greets the returning hunters warmly, jumping around with enthusiasm for their quarry.  
* Many women turn out to prepare the meat, using their Ulu to cut it into many pieces.  
* Arfeq, the elderly man, says,   
  *"I am a man of many wrinkles, and my eyes are tired. The time has come to take my final hunt. The snow blows in the time of the sun, but I see that we have a season of great plenty ahead. The Qallunaat have won much game, and brought the gun to help our hunters thrive.*  
    
  *My eyes are tired. No longer can I cast a spear, and I will not tend to children for it is not my station. Farewell my son Kumaglak. You are a better hunter than ever I was, and you raise your children with kindness and a firm hand. Thank you, leader of the Qallanuut, for the chance to see your faces and hear the strangeness of your ways.*  
    
  *My eyes are tired. Things may change much, now but I need not see my own driven from our homes.*  
    
  *Now I will do what my mother in law Tiglak had not the strength to do. Never did I complain of Tiglak. Not even once. I shall burden my son no longer."*  
    
  Kumaglak holds Arfeq's hand and gives him a hug, and a fresh piece of seal meat. Then Arfeq walks into the blowing snow storm. He will last a long time, but eventually freeze to death. If Tuktu is asked about this he [replies](#bookmark=id.y3cysflfh8k).

# **Hunting**  {#hunting}

To hunt the players must

* Prepare  
* Travel  
* Stalk  
* Attack

**Before the hunt**, Tuktu will always say this:

*All creatures of the deep belong to Sedna the sea goddess. She is jealous for them.*  
*Only to a hunter of great skill will Sedna the sea goddess give up her children*  
*In times of her anger there is famine in the land.*

*Blow a song of praise to the \<hunted animal\>. May your arm be strong and may the spirits hear your song and be pleased. May they look upon you with kindness and gift you with a life. Be thankful, and respectful, and live by your word, and your spear shall aim true.*

**After the Hunt**, all share in the good fortune of the hunter. The hunter's illuvigak becomes the place of slaughter, and families come to the door one by one and say "Hereby somebody comes visiting." and the visitor is made welcome.

*If the sea goddess gives the hunter a seal, let the hunter be thankful. Let the hunter honor the memory of netzerk (the seal). Come to my illuvigak and share with me the bounty of Sedna the Sea Goddess. Come to my illuvigak and feast with me. The oil under the pot burns brightly. Let the children sleep with full bellies.*

## Seal Hunt {#seal-hunt}

Can hunt seal three ways:

* **Blowholes** \- Stand at the blowholes (safe but slow). Guns can't be used because the seals will sink. Stand back, and when your seal indicators [PIC](https://americanindian.si.edu/webmultimedia/4098/221/026.700x700.jpg) is tripped, lunge forward and strike with harpoon. Reel up the seal with the harpoon line.  
* **On-Ice** \- Approach sleeping seals by pretending you're a seal (difficult but faster). One gun shot can work, but all seals will flee. *"Now is the time for the hunter to think like netzerk. To have thoughts in his head like the thoughts of the seal."* Tuktu gives instructions. [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z824vCrG5iQ&t=560s)  
* **Kayak** \- Use spears and nets in the precarious boat (very risky for beginners, but fastest)

**Size:** Roll 3d6 to find the size of the seal. 11 means "the size of a man".

**Custom:** Upon gaining a seal it will be offered a drink of fresh water, because all sea creatures are always considered to be thirsty. [deets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inuit_cuisine#Hunting_beliefs)

### Preparation {#preparation}

Players may bring their own gear, or have some provided for them.

* Each hunter needs:  
* harpoon with a spear thrower base [PIC](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/00/Harpon_Unaaq_MHNT_ETH_AC_198.jpg/1280px-Harpon_Unaaq_MHNT_ETH_AC_198.jpg)  
* whalebone snow goggles [PIC](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/16/dd/75/16dd756b59160c287ed9993ce71a4fa2.jpg)  
* watertight boots in three layers (mukluks) [PIC](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/ce/Inuit_footwear%2C_Iglulik%2C_1987_-_Bata_Shoe_Museum_-_DSC00395.JPG/1280px-Inuit_footwear%2C_Iglulik%2C_1987_-_Bata_Shoe_Museum_-_DSC00395.JPG)  
* ulu knife [PIC](http://media.britishmuseum.org/media/Repository/Documents/2019_6/5_11/f60197bf_2701_4f5a_98bb_aa6300ba86b7/preview_am1855_1126_326__a_.jpg)  
* Snow shoes (tugluk), just in case  
* depth poking stick.  
* Common gear is spoon-like ice digging stick, and some medical herb paste

Ice topography, poke it often to avoid thin ice dangers. Use the dogs' noses to find the blowholes hidden beneath the snow, then use the spoon digger to reveal them.

### Option \#1: Stalking Seals {#option-#1:-stalking-seals}

- Using your while fur side guards, you must get prone on your side on the ice. Then, act like a seal, low on the ice, moving as a lump as if you have flippers, faking sleep, brushing the snow like a flipper  
- At some point you must stand, run, and strike before netserk escapes into the blowhole 

### Option \#2: Blowhole Hunt {#option-#2:-blowhole-hunt}

When a 

- Roll to act like a seal and approach. DC 7 (6 at blowhole)  
- Roll to strike (or opponent slips beneath the ice) DC 5 (4 at the blow hole)  
- Roll to brace yourself and pull up the seal (or drop the rope, or get bitten, or slip) DC 4

### Travel {#travel}

Moving across the ice varies. The spaces are vast, and full of blinding glare. Anyone without snow goggles (xxx) will suffer snow blindness (illuktuk) which gradually heals.

### After

- Dogs drag the body back in harness   
- In a huge igloo, entrance covered by a seal skin, using ulu [pic](https://thumbs.worthpoint.com/zoom/images1/1/0113/21/vintage-inuit-eskimo-hand-made-ulu_1_3f272e894b7f76424912f564b398fda5.jpg) (woman's knife) special incredibly sharp obsidian knives [pic](https://voyij.com/image/product/2684/ORIGINAL/0/10932/), the seal is dressed by the women, hung and dried.  
- Note: women don't hunt, because from a Darwinian perspective you can't repopulate the tribe without women  
- Oil for cooking and light, skin for clothes, guts for rope, Pemmican is made that lasts twice as long as regular jerky.

## Whale Hunt {#whale-hunt}

### Preparation

- Kayaks and harpoons. Lots of praying

### Travel

- Various ocean dangers

### Stalk

- Who will spot the blowing spout of the whale?  
- Can they reach it before it vanishes? Wait patiently while the whale dives and feeds, or is there a youngster that need protecting?

### Attack

- Roll to maneuver  
- Roll to strike (and final strike)  
- Roll to avoid capsize  
- An Orca pod will show up and compete with the party for the kill. Can you get the whale to shore before

## Egg Gathering {#egg-gathering}

## Fishing {#fishing}

If it is summer, the group will be lead to a fish weir. In winter holes must be drilled in the ice.

### Preparation {#preparation-1}

* Standard clothing

# **Hunting Songs** {#hunting-songs}

*I walked on the ice of the sea*  
*All was lonely. All was quiet.*

## Krava Kakivak {#krava-kakivak}

[PIC](https://imgur.com/gallery/Lp5lZTd)  
Called Krava Kakivak (robe \+ spear) by the locals, Maximilian Robespierre is now aged 60\. Spirited from Paris at the last moment before his guillotining, he survives with the help of hired Netsilik assistants, and has married a Netsilik woman. 

*Don't you see it? Don't you SEE it? Napoleon understood. He found the secret journals of the hidden saint. Yes\! But not in Nursia, no\! In Ajaccio, whence they had been spirited\!*

*He learned. He knew. He saw the tendrils of corruption spelling the Fate of Man\! He fought against Inscius\! He fought against Deprava\! And he won\! Well, mostly. Well, an effect. He had an effect. But we are farther than we have ever been\! It was he that opened the floodgates to revolution and the equality of brothers\!*

*Our evils are not our fault. Those who can not see it are the enemy, willingly or not, knowingly or not, they corrupt all that the true heart attempts. So they must die\! Of course. Of course. There is only one solution. It must be the final solution.*

*Should one man have a greater voice than another, when all must live, and all are endowed with the natural right to life? No\!*

*Should one man subjugate another? No\! A violation of the natural right to liberty\! Whatever harms you not is none of your business\!*

*One must take up arms in self defense against those who would oppress\! One's voice must be heard, without limit\! The impartial law must rule, not the voice of fragile and egotistical men. Let no man be raised above another\!*

*There is no human cost too great to achieve these noble and universal goals. And I exacted that cost, morally, ethically, mercilessly. And so should all those who understand our peril.*

*They spat upon the Cult of the Supreme Being\! Reason, yes of course, it has value. But the human heart yearns for the truth of the divine. But more importantly, why can they not see the corruption of religion, below the surface, deeply hidden, subtle, slow, and long, so long in patience: the Jovian influence that will yield the extinction of us all. Better to spill the blood of millions than risk the loss of our billion souls\!*

He speaks of the many killed when he ran the government during the French Reign of Terror, when he ran security and 27,000 opponents of revolution were killed.

His beliefs include:

* Every man should have the right to vote, whatever their station  
* Abolish the perversion of clerical celibacy  
* Slavery must be stopped everywhere  
* Equality under a written law

Gallery of String Figures [PIC](http://www.torusflex.com/string-figures/images/jeff-wang-murphy-portraits/), [LINK](http://www.isfa.org/sfm.htm)

The string figures made by the Netsilik girls are spirit-related. When the string is made by a wise woman (shaman) very quickly after an animal's death it is woven with remnant Ether from the life of the creature. This imbues it with sufficient Ether Thread that certain effects might be achieved.

On a more mundane level it can redirect the wind, for example towards a fire, or to blow smoke where desired.

**\[CO\] Catching Objects**: [PIC](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/uh2dqG-T0Xs/0.jpg), Small objects can be briefly caught in, for example, a spider web. Momentum means little, only size matters, so a bullet, dart or arrow may be caught.

**\[CR\] Curse Resistance:** [PIC](http://www.torusflex.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/klamath-net-drawing.jpg) Wise women can make figures that shield them from the onslaught of curses.

Make a difficulty roll to determine whether you can create a configuration into which you can put the information, then when your partner takes the string figure into the next form they will get the message, without risk of bad luck. Some messages consume the string. Some are simply too complex to convey and the skill of the creator can not meet the demand.

### Tuktu on Arfeq {#tuktu-on-arfeq}

Tuktu's answer if asked about Arfeq: [deets](https://ethicsofsuicide.lib.utah.edu/tradition/indigenous-cultures/arctic-cultures/netsilik-eskimo/) He tells the story of Arfeq and his mother in law, many years ago, and how she often had to sleep on the ice when they moved camp, because she could not move fast enough to arrive at the new camp by nightfall.

*No one here among us wishes harm to old people. We ourselves might be old some day. Perhaps there are those among us who think Arfeq might take more care of his mother-in-law, particularly by giving her better clothes. But others excuse Arfeq, in that he has been so unlucky in his hunting that he has barely been able to procure furs for his wife and his children, and people think he must first and foremost attend to them; for not only are they more closely related to him, but they have their lives before them and they may live long, whereas there is no future for an old worn-out woman.*

*Then again there are others who think that Arfeq should allow his mother-in-law to ride on his sledge, or at any rate go back for her when he has built his snow hut, while others say that he only has two dogs and with his wife has to help to drag his sledge from place to place. And if he has to be at the breathing holes next morning at the proper time to secure food he can not travel backwards and forwards between the old and the new camp to salvage an old woman.*

*He has the choice between helping one who is at deaths door anyhow, and allowing his wife and children to starve. This is how it is, and we see no wickedness in it. Perhaps it is more remarkable that old Kigtaq, now that she is no longer able to fend for herself, still hangs on as a burden to her children and grandchildren. For our custom up here is that all old people who can do no more, and whom death will not take, help death to take them.*

*And they do this not merely to be rid of a life that is no longer a pleasure, but also to relieve their nearest relations of the trouble they give them.”*

### The Spirit Who Lived in All Beasts {#the-spirit-who-lived-in-all-beasts}

THERE was a man whose name was Avôvang. And of him it is said that nothing could wound him. And he lived at Kangerdlugssuaq. And a time came that those of dark spirit sought him out, to end his life, for he was a good and righteous hunter.

Their sledges drove up before his illuvigak, and Avôvang went out to meet them, though his wife cowered behind the walls of ice. He took with him the skin of a dog's neck, which had been used to wrap him warmly when he was a child. When the men fell upon him, he simply placed that piece of skin on the ground and stood on it, and all his enemies could not wound him with their weapons, though they stabbed again and again.

At last he spoke, and said mockingly:

"All my body is now like a piece of knotty wood, with the scars of the wounds you gave me, and yet you could not bring about my death."

At last they were forced to sled away, without having done what they wished.

It is also told of Avôvang, that he once desired to travel to the people who lived in the south, to buy wood. This men were wont to do in the old days, but now it is no longer so.

So they set off, many sledges together, going southward to buy wood. And having done what they wished, they set out for home. On the way, they had made a halt to look for the breathing holes of seal, and while the men had been thus employed, the women had gone on. Avôvang had taken a wife on that journey, from among the people of the south.

And while the men stood there looking for seal holes, all of them felt a great desire to possess Avôvang's wife, and therefore they tried to kill him. Qautaq stabbed him in the eyes, and the others caught hold of him and sent him sliding down through a breathing hole into the sea.

 When his wife saw this, she was angry, and taking the wood which they had brought from the south, she broke it all into small pieces. So angry was she at thus being made a widow.

 Then she went home, after having spoiled the men's wood. But the sledges drove on.

 Suddenly a great seal came up ahead of them, right in their way, where the ice was thin and slippery. And the sledges drove straight at it in hopes to harpoon it, but many fell through and were drowned at that hunting. And a little after, they again saw something in their way. It was a fox, and they set off in chase, but driving at furious speed up a mountain of screw-ice, they were dashed down and killed. Only two men escaped, and they made their way onward and told what had come to the rest.

 And it was the soul of Avôvang, whom nothing could wound, that had changed, first into a **seal** and then into a **fox**, and thus brought about the death of his enemies. And afterwards he made up his mind to let himself be born in the shape of every beast of earth, that he might one day tell his fellow-men the manner of their life.

 At one time he was a **dog**, and lived on meat which he stole from the houses. When he was pressed for food, he would carefully watch the men about the houses, and eat anything they threw away.

 But Avôvang soon tired of being a dog, on account of the many beatings which fell to his lot in that life.

 And so he made up his mind to become a **reindeer**. At first he found it far from easy, for he could not keep pace with the other reindeer when they ran.

 "How do you stretch your hind legs at a gallop?" he asked one day.

 "Kick out towards the farthest edge of the sky," they answered. And he did so, and then he was able to keep pace with them.

 But at first he did not know what he should eat, and therefore he asked the others.

 "Eat moss and lichen," they said.

 And he soon grew fat, with thick suet on his back.

 But one day the herd was attacked by a wolf, and all the reindeer dashed out into the sea, and there they met some kayaks in their flight, and one of the men killed Avôvang.

 He cut him up, and laid the meat in a cairn of stones. And there he lay, and when the winter came, he longed for the men to come and bring him home. And glad was he one day to hear the stones rattling down, and when they commenced to eat him, and cracked the bones with pieces of rock to get at the marrow, Avôvang escaped and changed himself into a wolf.

 And now he lived as a wolf, but here as before he found that he could not keep up with his comrades at a run. And they ate all the food, so that he got none.

 "Kick up towards the sky," they told him. And then at once he was able to overtake all the reindeer, and thus get food.

 And later he became a walrus, but found himself unable to dive down to the bottom; all he could do was to swim straight ahead through the water.

 "Take off as if from the middle of the sky; that is what we do when we dive to the bottom," said the others. And so he swung his hindquarters up to the sky, and down he went to the bottom. And his comrades taught him what to eat; mussels and little white stones.

 Once also he was a raven. "The ravens never lack food," he said, "but they often feel cold about the feet."

 Thus he lived the life of every beast on earth. And at last he became a seal again. And there he would lie under the ice, watching the men who came to catch him. And being a great wizard, he was able to hide himself away under the nail of a man's big toe.

 But one day there came a man out hunting who had cut off the nail of his big toe. And that man harpooned him. Then they hauled him up on the ice and took him home.

 Inside the house, they began cutting him up, and when the man cast the mittens to his wife, Avôvang went with them, and crept into the body of the woman. And after a time he was born again out of that woman, and became once more a man.

## Nukúnguasik, Who Escaped from the Tupilak

NUKÚNGUASIK, it is said, had land in a place with many brothers. When the brothers made a catch, they gave him meat for the pot; he himself had no wife. One day he rowed northward in his kayak, and suddenly he took it into his head to row over to a big island which he had never visited before, and now wished to see. He landed, and went up to look at the land, and it was very beautiful there.

And here he came upon the middle one of many brothers, busy with something or other down in a hollow, and whispering all the time. So he crawled stealthily towards him, and when he had come closer, he heard him whispering these words:

"You are to bite Nukúnguasik to death; you are to bite Nukúnguasik to death."

And then it was clear that he was making a Tupilak, and stood there now telling it what to do. But suddenly Nukúnguasik slapped him on the side and said: "But where is this Nukúnguasik?"

And the man was so frightened at this that he fell down dead.

And then Nukúnguasik saw that the man had been letting the Tupilak sniff at his body. And the Tupilak was now alive, and lay there sniffing. But Nukúnguasik, being afraid of the Tupilak, went away without trying to harm it.

Now he rowed home, and there the many brothers were waiting in vain for the middle one to return. At last the day dawned, and still he had not come. And daylight came, and then as they were preparing to go out in search of him, the eldest of them said to Nukúnguasik:

"Nukúnguasik, come with us; we must search for him."

And so Nukúnguasik went with them, but as they found nothing, he said: "Would it not be well to go and make search over on that island, where no one ever goes?"

[PIC](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/28932/28932-h/images/p018.jpg)

And having gone on to the island, Nukúnguasik said: "Now you can go and look on the southern side."

When the brothers reached the place, he heard them cry out, and the eldest said: "O wretched one\! Why did you ever meddle with such a thing as this\!"

And they could be heard weeping all together about the dead man.

And now Nukúnguasik went up to them, and there lay the Tupilak, still alive, and nibbling at the body of the dead man. But the brothers buried him there, making a mound of stones above him. And then they went home.

Nukúnguasik lived there as the oldest in the place, and died at last after many years.

Here I end this story: I know no more.

## Creatures {#creatures}

### Tupilak {#tupilak}

Plural is Tupilait  
A kind of maleficent golem created by a dark mage. It is typically a compilation of various animal bones and skin, and must be brought to life by an ilise'cut. As long as it has food it will live. With a golem crystal food is no longer mandatory for life, though it will still hunger and being to rot.

### Ilise'cut {#ilise'cut}

One who practices dark spirit magic, quick to anger, to bring misfortune upon others. From Knud Rasmussen:

*"If now a shaman desires to injure a person by magic, someone whom he does not like and of whom he has grown envious, he will first endeavor to obtain some object belonging to the person concerned; this he takes and speaks ill over it, and keeps on speaking ill over it, hoping thus to pass on the evil to the person he desires to hurt. And should he discover a powerful or destructive force, such as for instance that which may lie concealed in a grave, then he must rub the object he is speaking ill over into the grave.*

*This may give rise to sickness, madness or enmity ending in homicide. ilise'cut can also steal away the soul of a human being by supibluqo: by "blowing it out", so that the soul rushes out of the body; care must be taken, however, that the persons to be injured have no idea that they have enemies; it is essential to maintain friendly relations with them in everyday life. When at last the object is so far attained that the soul has been driven out of the victim, helping spirits are called in to pursue and destroy it. And it will then not be long before the man who has lost his soul falls ill and dies.*

*Should it be discovered that a shaman is given to the practice of stealing souls — and the suspicion may arise where a shaman is unfortunate with his patients — then he will be killed by his neighbors. Here also the recoil of evil deeds upon the evil-doer is well known: for when a soul is stolen away and the man dies, the stolen soul may return and slay the one who stole it."*
