## **Ice Sigils** {#ice-sigils}

The underside of the polar ice cap is etched with giant sigils similar to the vegvisir, known as the Ice Sigils, that guard the Earth against easy access by Portal from other worlds (specifically Jupiter).

The first thing players will see is long lines, clearly carved into the ice intentionally, about a foot wide and a foot deep [PIC](https://i.imgur.com/9tKEond.jpeg). Following one such will lead to 30 meter circumference sigil [PIC](https://i.imgur.com/BMNahWc.jpeg),

Tuktu has seen these. His story:

*When I was a little boy a white man came from England to tell us about the Christian god, and the greatness of the King of England. He taught me many things, but the thing I remembered most was how to swim in the cold waters of Sedna the Sea Goddess. That missionary was a kind man, but that winter the Aarluk \[killer whales\] came upon him unawares at the edge of the ice and he was seen no more.*

*Years later my father taught me to hunt Netserk the seal. My father was wise, and taught me well, but I was young and very foolish. One day, at the blowhole, I spied a great ripple in the water. Without thinking I threw my harpoon and gripped the line to bring netserk from the sea.*

*But the pull from my harpoon was too great, and I was dragged into the hole. Too stubborn to release the line, I was pulled under, into the icy cold water.*

*Sedna the Sea Goddess was mischievous that day. Through the blue mists of the water I saw a gigantic shape: my strike had hit a passing whale. Through the cold sea I spun, my amazed young eyes stung by the sharp salt of the sea. When my hands went numb I let go. For a moment I was stunned, and drifted deep in the freezing water.*

*In that calm moment I looked above me, for that was surely where I must swim to regain line. Above me, in the bottom of the ice, I saw strange etchings: Huge they were, and deep, where the ice always stays from season to season. I saw a central ring with eight arms, each decorated differently. From each arm extended a long, engraved, wavering line. The lines glowed with light from above. I wondered: who had put them there? The glowing lines stretched far out of sight in the salty sea.*

*Short on air I swam for the surface, as the missionary had taught me, but found the roof of sea ice complete and unbroken, keeping me from the life-giving air above. I sucked from small bubbles trapped below the ice, and waited for my death to find me. My final moment in this life arrived, and I sank.*

*But my father broke through the ice as I floated, lifeless, towards the bottom. He struck me with his harpoon, and pulled me to safety. See, I still have the scar on my shoulder. And you can see, I did not die that day.*

It was the mystery of the sigils that prompted him to keep an eye out for strange things (he does not consider the morning stars strange) and years later, in the stomach of a whale his tribe had hunted, he found the strange prokythera device he gave to Wellington in gratitude for an Englishman teaching him to swim.

## **Mega Sponge** {#mega-sponge}

The enormous sponge blue and white, and large enough to navigate a submersible or Jovian crab through. It is also 3D replica of our quadrant of the universe, cultured by the Zocto for protection.

The sponge creates a low thrumming noise that Throckmorton at first confuses for the engine, but then enchants him and he can't get out of his head. [AUDIO](https://youtu.be/pq5PnvHYp7U)

## **Voyage To Syzygy** {#voyage-to-syzygy}

There are two possibilities:

1. The players bring the submersible to the Viking pit, either by dog mushing it over the glacier, or by finding an underwater entrance to the tube. About 48 hours of travel.  
2. The players travel an ocean-filled lava tube deep into the earth. It is clear the earth is snaked through with these, but there is a main path that clearly leads deeper. About 96 hours of travel.

Within, hidden, is the water-filled lava tube that leads deep into the earth and arrives at a Lava lake, upon the shores of which rests Syzygy.

The Aphotic Zone, at depths \>1000m have no photosynthesis. Strange huge creatures roam here. The terrain includes:

- Lava Tubes lead deep into the earth, to caverns and submerged lava lakes, and then back up to elsewhere on the earth  
- Volcanic Vents  
- Giant Kelp Forests  
- Schools of fish to hide within

An enormous city-ship used by the Zocto to flea Jupiter when the Corruptor arrived, now dilapidated and long abandoned.

## **Plot** {#plot}

* Discover that the Zocto are Jovian creatures, and that those met in Zayan ruins are degenerate descendents.  
* Learn how to make better pressure suits, and gather the metals to make them.  
* Find nuclear torpedos  
* Associate the eight-pointed Icelandic vegvisir runes with the eight armed Zocto  
* First hints of the Ioans.  
* Driven from Syzygy by a swarm of small crabs.  
* At the end fight off the giant crabs etc that the Corruptor sent eons ago, and which ruined the Zocto techno-culture

## **Approach** {#approach}

3 miles in diameter

If the players take the Leyden Tube they will arrive at a nexus with many tubes angling upwards, but no obvious way to rise up any of them. They will have to take the sub out a water-membrane tunnels, find Syzygy, and then rise up via an ocean laval tube.

Passing an underwater lava lake, you see the bioluminescent lights of the city in the distance. Tall fronds of some unusual kelp stand in a forest around the strange lights \[\[it is the Goliath Crabs hibernating with kelp growing all over them\]\] A glass Zocto will float by [PIC](https://mymodernmet.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/octopus-blackwater-photography-Wu-Yung-sen-1.jpg). 

## **Locations** {#locations}

Everywhere within the city ship there is ankle-deep water, and the little spiky eggs.

### Entrance {#entrance}

A large intentional hole in the base of the ship gives entrance to a huge space. There are inset bays around a huge moon pool, that happen to perfectly fit the sub.

Upon exiting the sub, they will see seaweed around the fringes, ankle-deep water, and barnacles on the floor, indicating that this place was submerged at some point.

* Scattered among the barnacles are strange, spiky eggs [PIC](https://i.imgur.com/cU8LmND.jpeg).  
* A huge 18' tall "statue" stands in the middle of the open space. [PIC](https://i.etsystatic.com/21574308/r/il/538154/3920891620/il_794xN.3920891620_amni.jpg) It is a still mech.  
  * 24' tall standing  
  * One tentacle is poorly functioning  
  * It can shoulder-mount implosion torpedoes  
  * It has sonar imaging  
* You get the feeling that this area is meant to be filled with air.  
* **The rest of the city is meant to be in air, but it has been flooded**

18' exit doors, for cargo. It has intrinsic lighting.

Of the other sites, only 1/4 mile around.

Giant empty place, with mounts that are bare.  
64 degrees temp in here, water is 58 degrees.

3 doors, with 36' recessed apart airlock doors that rotate in.

- \#1 dead ends in a door (warehouse)  
- Center 36' tall, and airlocks 36'. has three inset rails of obsidian glass. Goes up. To 100' platform

\*\* Mecha with Zocto in the head?

### DONE 2.2 Guide Room {#done-2.2-guide-room}

* There will be strange artifacts, and a room with a Zocto-suitable Guide (adaptable to humans) and Tablets. These are Jovian Zocto artifacts, not the creations of the Zayans.  
* Discover the technology for creating pressure suits, but only Zocto can perform the eight-armed manufacturing  
* There are a few spiky eggs here.  
*   
* DC 6 to get the helmet on, DC 4 to switch tablets  
  * It goes by usage, not by person.  
  * Second time DC 7 and 5, and so on.

Medical \- you can mechanically alter, or biologically alter. The two are incompatible. All licked people reveal a long-ago non-evolvable alteration.

The Artist

- He cares about history.  
- He will find out about the history of his people first.  
- He learns about the Deep Ancients and the incredibly dangerous technology farming.  
- He will learn about the crabs, and find he knows more than the Ancestors.  
  - What happened  
  - How to kill them  
  - What secret weapon was about to be made  
  -   
- He comes back speaking native English in a thick, upper crust accent.

Hundreds of the strange eggs litter the floor here [PIC](https://i.imgur.com/cU8LmND.jpeg).

Upon the wall a huge bas relief tells a story in, of course, eight panels:

1. Images of a strange round city seemingly rising above swirling clouds. In Zocto it says "Ready for Travel"  
2. A strange image of a single line swirling around filled circles. Zocto text: "The Route" [PIC](https://images.raumfahrer.net/news/ISEE3ICEtrajectorynasa1500.jpg)

4. The same city in some kind of enormous water-filled tube. Zocto text: "Seeking Depths"  
5. Zocto without armor frolic about the same city, now lit with bioluminescent lights. It is a bright image, full of hope and freedom. Zocto text: "New Home"  
6. Nightmare creatures, tall and crablike [PIC](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/25/59/29/25592947a9cd4f8d67bf1dc78655609a.jpg), emerging through an enormous gate with that shows swirling clouds. They crush Zocto in their claws, ravage the city. Zocto text: "Attacked\!"  
7. Brave Zocto using a mysterious, sharp light to carve enormous runes into the bottom of polar ice. Zocto text: "Defense"  
8. In the foreground the gate breaks [pic](https://i.pinimg.com/564x/ce/0c/7d/ce0c7dff8f6b5938ecb79f8f6983fb99.jpg). In the background terrible crab creatures are seen feeding on Zocto, and breeding while the city floods. Zocto text: "Victory and Despair"

The crabs are nocturnal, waking in the evening.

### Crab Attack

1. Silhouettes: When the players look outside the windows of the city ship, they will see huge silhouettes moving in the lava-lit darkness. Play first 20 seconds of this [VIDEO](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQyopA3JoWo) (no sound). They will head clacking noises.  
2. Not long after, clacking will begin inside. The . [VIDEO](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQyopA3JoWo&t=1m27s)

Huge Jovian horrors in the shape of crabs appear outside the city-ship.

Misc Crabs [PIC](http://PIC)  
Goliath Crabs [link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ml4MhMjmapNTFYD-ifeZb_XncwotmAcRF9zSmtC7zb0/edit#bookmark=id.b66r1ltf6tfj)

- Inedible. Look like [this](https://rachelstabledotcom1.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/img_0244.jpg).  
- Can't much swim. Flying above them keeps you pretty safe.  
- They make a smell that upsets the adults when killed.

Goliath babies

- 4 difficulty, but 7 for mental connection. 2 for non-earth, and 1 for bred hostility  
- 5 in combat, because they are   
- 4 health
