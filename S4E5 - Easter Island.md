[Moai Information](http://www.bradshawfoundation.com/easter/easter_island.php)

## Plot {#plot}

Rapa Nui is the home of Orongo, the Ward of Changes.

Once the site of Corrupt experiments in morphing humans and consuming the environment through overpopulation and resource overconsumption, Rapa Nui now bears the ruins of opposing tribes:

* The Moala, worshipers of Moai based in Puakatike Crater  
* The Orophagians, body morphers and spirit masters

## Secret

The great secret is that 100,000s of people used to live here in a great, thriving civilization. After the Moai were intentionally allowed by the Corruptor to "escape" here the residents began to discover that they could achieve immortality in their age by relinquishing their souls, via the Ahu, into a Moa. Little did they know that the Corruptor would then control them, and bring them to Jupiter as slaves.

Everywhere the ruins of that civilization are obscured behind Reality Alteration, and it requires Reality Discipline to see the truth of the island \- that nearly everywhere are the ruins of this once thriving civilization.

## Themes {#themes}

The main idea is to demonstrate to the players that **humans can consume all the resources** on its sustaining land and destroy themselves.

* **Scarce Resources** \- there is zero food on the island, unless you fight others for it. There are no trees, and little shelter except the caves.  
* **Ward of Shaping (II):** The violability of the human body. Plant men, bird men, stone men.  
* **Jovians** \- The nature of Jovian creatures, such as those seen in the deep sea and a few that have made it to land.  
* **Fatalism** \- Fatalistic determinism and ecology, the interconnectedness of all things  
* **Submersible Teamwork** \- Team play in the sub. Battling the moai on land fruitlessly and in the sub effectively.

**Problem**  
Upon arrival the submersible will be attacked and disabled by an unknown force (a moa walking under the water), stranding the PCs and crew. Some uranium may be lost.

**Thread** 

* Reveal the secrets of the Moala and Orophagians: spirit-powered moa and andromorph tattoo kidnappings.  
* Find the underground moai works, where obsidian moai are built then wrapped in a sheath of thin stone and brought to the surface for imbuing with a sentient spirit.  
* Discover the volcano  
* Probably get captured to become andromorphs  
* Uncover that Orongo rules them, is the Ward, transports moai via a gate to Jupiter to be slaves.

**Resolution**: Acquire new uranium, improve the sub, create tiny nukes for torpedoes. Battle Obsidian Moai with the sub. Stop Orongo's march to join the Eighth Ward, blowing him up.

**Horrors**:

* A dignified brit, maybe Arkwright, looming from the darkness of a hut, horrifically seen as a shambling bird man [pic](https://bloody-disgusting.com/news/3225847/no-these-creature-illustrations-arent-silent-hill-concept-art/#jp-carousel-3225852), mumbling "old chap" and "this won't do".  
* Andromorphs: In the water around the underwater dock, vap men [pic](https://www.deviantart.com/yce-fyre/art/Ashmoth-341352669)  
* Wise, aged leaders put in a brazen bull like device to shackle their spirits to moai.  
* The "we unwisely denuded our own island. We deserve it." attitude of the native. Gaslighting just punishment.

### Background {#background}

While Orongo slept, and "gifts" were placed at ahu altars by the corruptor for hundreds of years, two factions arose on Rapa Nui. 

- The Moala befriended the Moai, sacrificing elders to provide powering spirits and mining the Moa Deeps to find cupric Crystals as power. They lived in semi-harmony with the moai, neither slaves now equals, reveling in the power of their allies.  
- The Orophagians, led by Spirit Master Bahira and his priest cast of Spirit Masters, worshiped Orongo. They studied deeply in their volcano institute, unraveling the secrets of genetics (deeply linked to spirit and the nature of "what you are"), eventually building andromorph biotech to overcome and dominate the enemy.  
- Both worked until the modern age to annihilate each other.

# **Island Locations** {#island-locations}

### Island Overview {#island-overview}

Whipped by incessant winds and frequent rain. Fields of obsidian, no real beaches. 

**Landing** \- Upon first landing one will:

* See the Shore  
* On landing, see turtles laying eggs  
* Meet the Makassan Trepangers  
* Find a Dahlverna lith and find one washed up on shore

### Makassans {#makassans}

After a short time two large boats [PIC](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Sally-May/publication/352798234/figure/fig3/AS:1039721975263234@1624900444866/Praos-bouguis-a-la-voile-Baie-Raffles-Voiture-chinoise-Ile-Banda-Depiction-of-a.png) of Makassan Trepangers [PIC](https://www.pastmasters.net/uploads/2/6/7/5/26751978/maccs-3_orig.png), [PIC](https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/f73bd16a8e256507dd53a9a88c3d596f?impolicy=wcms_crop_resize&cropH=447&cropW=668&xPos=0&yPos=30&width=862&height=575) will round a cape, carrying their plentiful trepang harvest [PIC](https://image.tcmwiki.com/image/%E6%B5%B7%E5%8F%82/%E6%B5%B7%E5%8F%82.jpg) (live) which they have dried for the voyage home [PIC](https://i0.wp.com/sybaritica.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Dried-Sea-Cucumber-03.jpg?resize=679%2C564&ssl=1). The Makassans are very dark, with curly hair, and short, wearing only loin clothes. They carry spears with metal tips. Lead weights hang upon their boats.

Their chief is Pobassoo, a short elderly man who will stop to talk. Assuming anyone can understand their language, their Pobassoo will say:

*We depart Rapa Nui wealthy but shadowed by grief. We have been visited by three curses and one good fortune.*

*Rich harvests of trepang have we found, sailing in our Praus (the name of the boat type). Trepang we have gutted, boiled, dried and smoked for our return voyage of many days. Yet what are riches to the life of a friend?*

*This was the first curse, that many dove for the last time. Deep they went, skillful searchers, respected among their fellow hunters. Yet never again above the waves shall they rise. The stony sea bed grasps them and they return not.*

*The second curse comes from the island. We slept upon it, as many times we have before. Never again shall we do so, for abominations come of which we may not speak.*

*The final curse is the pox. Creeping in the night it touches my hunters and makes many bumpy children upon their bodies. See Ruleek? He is on his seventh day. [PIC](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b7/Man_with_facial_scarring_and_blindness_due_to_smallpox%2C_1972_%28cropped%29.jpg/800px-Man_with_facial_scarring_and_blindness_due_to_smallpox%2C_1972_%28cropped%29.jpg), [PIC](https://www.historylink.org/Content/Media/Photos/Large/Smallpox-patient-with-lesions-characteristic-of-the-disease-GHFox-1886.jpg) The pox has wrapped him like the octopus wraps the clam.*

*Now we return home in our open boat of sails, our many dried trepang bought at great cost. Perhaps you will be our second good fortune? We have stonefish poison and razor sharp stonefish barbs to trade.*

* *Drownings*  
* *Coming of Abominations*  
* *Warped Men*

### Shore {#shore}

Stoney with rounded but also some sharp obsidian, harsh waves and protruding rocks. PCs will see baby [turtles hatching](https://imgur.com/gallery/bfc4VXX). You might also see Dahlverna [link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ml4MhMjmapNTFYD-ifeZb_XncwotmAcRF9zSmtC7zb0/edit#bookmark=id.h9yf495dzc47) carvings [PIC](https://salsaworldtravellerblog.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/20191004_031007.jpg), and possibly a dead one washed up on shore.

### Battlegrounds {#battlegrounds}

Remains of battle grounds can still be seen. A few ancient bones stick from the earth. A layer of subsoil contains many obsidian spear points as a sign of sudden warfare. Islanders say there was cannibalism, as well as carnage.

### Moai Quarry "Ranu Raraku" {#moai-quarry-"ranu-raraku"}

[PIC](https://photos.google.com/album/AF1QipOTCRxzAnMfLbdoomC6wG7EACkwMejJcUYW5-QD/photo/AF1QipOL_kwMWxJiHRHo5XA8ytpLS0arEnXA1xmnVyUz)@ Where the moai carving was and is done.The colossal figures are in every stage of completion. Some are laid out on their backs with a sort of stone keel attaching them to the obsidian bedrock. Some stand, with eyes of pearl or coral. They reproduce moistly in the deep cave quarries, completing their gestational drying under the sun at Ranu Raraku.

### Ahu {#ahu}

[PIC](https://photos.google.com/album/AF1QipOTCRxzAnMfLbdoomC6wG7EACkwMejJcUYW5-QD/photo/AF1QipNpbOqZ286gB2Jg_AMqnH6pJgDgyg95m4JFm9AA)@  
Ceremonial flat stone altars scattered about the landscape. Hard to see, until you walk up to one. Those being morphed must the allowed time in the elements, strapped to the ahu, to transform, while existing toravians come and rub up against them. If they die, bodies are left to decompose on the Ahu.

REVISED: This is where people were strapped down to become Moai.

**Hitu's Hut** \- The dwelling of the witch Hitu.

**Rogeveen's House** \- The dwelling of Jacob Rogeveen.

### Hitorangi Village {#hitorangi-village}

[PIC](https://photos.google.com/album/AF1QipOTCRxzAnMfLbdoomC6wG7EACkwMejJcUYW5-QD/photo/AF1QipMJIG6_2CbNsov9j3yw_zA-4lxwStms4h0CkY9a)@  
Only 100 people of the Hitorangi tribe survive in an eponymous village. Lead by **Mariso Hitorangi**, a good Spirit Master who has the spirit sight. The Hitorangi are full of superstitions (see below) to keep away the Jovines and Moai, they will react with hostility thinking the strange European clothes are hiding Jovines, and that the whites bring more disease and death.

**Spirit Ward** \- Mariso keeps 20 spirits circled around the village as guardians against dark magics.They are all low power spirits, the ancestors of the current villagers.

**Foraging** there are little mushrooms that make you not care about yourself, nor your personal conduct. Any way that you measure yourself becomes irrelevant.

**On Approach**: Approaching PCs will be confronted with sounds of a war dance. [AUDIO](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BI851yJUQQw) (play without video) but if they attempt to negotiate Mariso will resist DC 6 but ultimately allow them to enter.

**Spirit Cleansing**: The learn to marshal spirits to defend an area, tread water for an hour in a certain cove. It has jellyfish that sting you, and you hallucinate. Then you must touch nothing impure **with your hands** (weapons, tools, other people, basically nothing) before you defeat an Orophagian with no help. You must not touch the Orophagian (not least because it will warp your genes) when you defeat it.

**After Entry**: They will perform ceremonies to cleanse the PCs of morphotoxins. [PIC](https://photos.google.com/album/AF1QipOTCRxzAnMfLbdoomC6wG7EACkwMejJcUYW5-QD/photo/AF1QipPoUteFsPZyyiHEmsVVQoSj3WF_fwJcivKAtTVG), [AUDIO](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5_HmlSzpPo&t=40s) This requires participation, and words of belief, which the PCs must make up and speak.

Mariso's story: Her people dwindle, stolen by the Chileans, and man-twisters, and their very souls to the stone men.

### Ana Kai Tangata {#ana-kai-tangata}

Hitu's (the witch's) Haunt

Is also known as “the cave of cannibals“. The oral tradition reflects ancient episodes of cannibalism on the island by the champion clan in the competition of the Tangata Manu. This group that resided in Mataveri, celebrated the victory with feasts and banquets that, sometimes, included human victims. Some of these cruel feasts took place in the cave, where they led the unfortunate rivals.

- The [cave](https://i0.wp.com/imaginarapanui.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/puntura-rupestre-manutara-ana-kai-tangata.jpg?resize=610%2C407&ssl=1)

# **The Moa Deeps** {#the-moa-deeps}

The Moai city within the island extends to the sea floor, where once trading with the Zocto existed. It is now overrun with **Jovines** and **mad Moai** in the final throes of spirit poisoning.

Stationed on an island in the middle of the crater, a stone building with 50' high entrance is built over the massive lava tube. 120' diameter pit with petrified wood ramp.

**1\. Lava Tube Caves** \- Very hot tubes wind in many directions. Vines wind along the walls (Jovines). Just inside is a Moa creation zone, where obsidian moai are being born. About 500m (1500') down you find the Gate.

Spirit Poisoned Moai roam the caves.

**1.5 The Gate** \- in the side of the largest lava tube. Open it to enter the market.

**2\. Cavern Market** \- Sea water laps the stone docks and knee-deep "trade stalls" in this market where one Moala and Zocto traded goods.

Has a spirit. It **pulls a spirit away**, temporarily, from a living host. Temporarily disabling them. To take the spirit at that moment is an **evil act**. **4 int.** Very sensitive to what you're using it for, so even slight transgressions will "open a door".

Stranded by his brother Jan, in a sibling betrayal, during his trip around the world, this English speaking Dutch is quite dressed up. He dresses in elaborate explorers gentleman's garb, complete with gloves every day and dines on silver dinnerware.

His secret? A Jovine got up to his neck before he swore servitude to Corruptor. He is functionally immortal, and knows that he fulfills God's will through his suffering. He is amoral as to causing that suffering in others, as sin can not be attributed to man.

He will invite the players to sleep in his large stone hut.

### Rogeveen's Philosophy {#rogeveen's-philosophy}

*Everything is necessary: ​​sin is not in the actions of man, but in his disposition. Therefore he becomes neither evil nor good by the first, but he can not be changed, so his sins also give no cause for displeasure to God. Christ has made us free from death, to make us different from what we already were: but to make us know how we were before: His death makes known to us that we are justified by God, and as a result of that no man can act against God’s will, so man may be as he ought to be, and may even be said never to have committed any sins, so the chosen one does not sin anymore and needs nothing to worry about because he is being judged before God. The will of God is not fulfilled by action, but by suffering, and faith is nothing but accepting that which Christ has revealed to us through his death.*

*In short, Christ’s death on the cross has redeemed all humans, and, therefore, humans are incapable of sin any more. Everything, including human suffering, is God’s will.* 

### Rogeveen's Diary {#rogeveen's-diary}

[https://www.bookofdaystales.com/jacob-roggeveen/](https://www.bookofdaystales.com/jacob-roggeveen/)

Rogeveen's Visit (and the killings)  
Their visit, peaceful at first, was marred by the killing of 10 to 12 local men in a skirmish that is rather vaguely described. When the fleet first anchored, local men swam out to their ships, and later came in canoes. They were intrigued by the ships, and were given gifts. They also very quickly took to stealing items from the ships. When an expedition went ashore, they traveled in gunboats, and went ashore in close quarters, fully armed. One group of men, not observed by Roggeveen, opened fire on locals when they felt threatened. Seemingly the problem was smoothed over, and the Dutchmen were regaled with chickens and tropical fruits.

# **\!Encounters** {#!encounters}

The Sentinels \- [PIC](https://smarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/moaithumb.jpg). They are the elders, and will speak with humans. But one is already corrupted with the andromorph cult [PIC](https://i0.wp.com/the-past.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/post-1_image3-43.jpg?ssl=1)

# **\!History** {#!history}

## Arrival of Orongo {#arrival-of-orongo}

200AD Sent from Jupiter as the Ward of Shaping, Orongo lay dormant for many years until awakened by the Rapa Nui settlers.

## Moai Escape {#moai-escape}

300AD The Corruptor allowed the Moai to believe they escaped to Rapa Nui. They arrived through Orongo's Gate and began farming the locals for animating spirits. In truth they have been entrapped into service of Orongo and are regularly sent back to Jupiter to serve as slaves. Many were stripped of their spirits, which now haunt the island, so they stand dead and mute vigil on ahu across the island.

Human Settlement  
400AD Because of fighting at home, Tuki continued, chief Hotu Matu’a gathered his followers for a voyage to a new land. His tattooist and priest, Hau Maka, had flown across the ocean in a dream and seen Rapa Nui and its location, which he described in detail. Hotu Matu’a and his brother-in-law set sail in long double canoes, loaded with people, food, water, plant cuttings and animals. After a voyage of two months, they sailed into Anakena Bay, which was just as the tattooist had described it.

## Discovery {#discovery}

Jacob Roggeveen [PIC](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c1/Portrait_of_Willem_de_Vlamingh%2C_Johannes_en_Nicholaas_Verkolje_%281690_-_1700%29.jpg), who arrived in 1722\. The Dutch named the island Paaseiland (Easter Island) to commemorate the day they arrived. In 1770, the Spanish viceroy of Peru sent an expedition to the island; the explorers spent four days ashore and estimated a native population of some 3,000 people. Just four years later, the British navigator Sir James Cook arrived to find Easter Island’s population decimated by what seemed to have been a civil war, with only 600 to 700 men and fewer than 30 women remaining.

The deaths of all on the island were required to power Orongo. But it was not enough. Now the PCs shipmates are needed for the final spirits. Some will be captured for sacrifice.

### Moai Creation {#moai-creation}

When a tribe chief or any strong tribe member dies, a moai was ordered to be sculpted in the Rano Raraku quarry and was later transported to its village and placed on an ahu or ceremonious altar. Once placed on its altar, the eyes and pukao were placed (a type of hat carved from red scoria), at which moment the moai obtained their mana and could exercise their power.

Carved from a soft stone called lapilli tuff (fictionally a protective, gestational covering).

When a statue is almost complete, the carvers drill holes through the keel to break it off from the bedrock, slide it down a slope into a big hole [PIC](https://moevarua.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/encabezado-rano-raraku.jpg), where they could stand it up to finish the back. Eye sockets are only carved once a statue was on its ahu, and white coral and giant pearl eyes inserted during ceremonies to awaken the moai’s power. Some statues are adorned with huge cylindrical hats or topknots of red scoria [PIC](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-DN4XceRutd0/VQ1l_FxHlhI/AAAAAAAAAS0/fVm3hgFcibc/s1600/scoria600.jpg), another volcanic stone.

### Andromorphs {#andromorphs}

In the elder days, a competition was established in which every year a representative of each clan, chosen by the leaders, would swim across shark-infested waters to Motu Nui, a nearby islet, to search for the season's first egg laid by a manutara (sooty tern). The first swimmer to return with an egg and successfully climb back up the cliff to Orongo would be named "Birdman of the year" and secure control over distribution of the island's resources for his clan for the year. Later, this was corrupted into andromorphism.

## Timeline {#timeline}

200AD Orongo is sent as a meteor to earth  
400AD the Polynesians arrive and colonize, slowly learning the Secrets of Orongo.  
1300AD the Moai are begun, eventually numbering 729 (9x9x9). Sent to Jupiter for slaves.  
1722AD The Dutch are the instrument of death, bringing diseases to the Rapa Nui people, filling Orongo with shackled spirits.  
1774 James Cook arrives to find only 600 men and 30 women. A purge to stop the corruptor, nut it was all part of the plan.  
1790 after years of disease the remaining living band together as Hitorangi, forming the village of Hanga Roa.

# **Treasure** {#treasure}

**Tablets** \- Decipherable tablets should be found. A chronicle talking about the loss of trees. The author was killed for protesting about it, and evangelizing to the people about it. He was told "shut up. The moai will solve it"

**Vision** \- A seer (Henton? Throckmorton drugged? Lucius?) should have a vision of the horrors of civilization: the slavers, the reign of Dutrou-Bornier etc.

**Tattoo Art** is important. Craftsmen. 

## Reagents: {#reagents:}

Can be found naturally plentifully protruding on the surface.

\- sulfur, potash, hollow bamboo wrapped with vines and river-rounded stones to make ad-hoc explosives.

## Superstitions: {#superstitions:}

\- burying placentas and the bones of ancestors to bring fertility and a good harvest.

\- carving more Moai to appease Orongo (this is true)

\- cutting off the pinky of every baby so that they have numerologically satisfactory nine fingers. Anyone entering the village (passing the inward-facing moai fence) must have this done.

\- When Rapa Nui die, their life enrgy flows into their Moa, which is true, but they don't realize that their spirits are then shackled there.

Open Questions & Reaserch

\- how to defeat a moa? Can you ride/control them?   
\- how to overcome a Jovine, and restore limbs lost to their depredations  
\- what capabilities for sub?  
\- What substance kills plants? Can it be a naturally occurring reagent used to defend the head against Jovines?  
\- How do submarines rise and sink??

\*\* Try to work in [Rano Kau](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7b/Rano-Kau-Crater-Gap-2013.jpg), the huge volcanic headland  
\*\* The Otu Itu are fighting the Tu'u,toppling Moai (all gone by 1860s)

Based on clues from Captain Q, the players seek out Easter Island. He tells the story of the USS Mohican's captain Bertrand Smith who felt a pull from the island "like a tentacle had wrapped around his throat and was pulling him" \- a sensation the PCs will have experienced. Smith also claims he saw giants gazing out to sea.

Docking on the leeward side of the island, in the only viable harbor, they come ashore to find three strange pits 15' deep. No sign of giants (nor the famed giant statues).

There they find the strange hermit Napopo (perceiving his steps, then tracking), who speaks to them in Pascuan (deciphering). He has a bite mark on his arm. Forensics indicate it is a human bite, but he will not talk about it. He describes a village of the dead, saying also that "the giants could not sing, so my people lost favor." He also begs to guide them, so that he can bring his mother to the Cave of Final Rest.

They also find a box, left behind by discoverer Roggeveen, with a dire warning in Dutch and French: "My crew begged me to leave this message: 'Do not take the gifts these natives offer.' Our first mate fell ill, lost his mind, tried to eat fire, ran screaming into the night. We found him at the base of a huge statue, hands and forehead rubbed raw. I can give no credence to their superstitious nonsense, yet they have served me well."

Volcanic cones, lava flows, and rough beauty.

Exploring (survival) deeper into the island, they spot a village (perception) just as night falls.

**A silent village** of about 100 people, populated only by fallen skeletons, all simultaneously dead, and all with no cause of death (forensics). All of their beads and jewelry are in place. The Corruptor has use them as an experiment in which they consumed all of their local resources and thus killed themselves I just I just went and looked up the notes I had about it there's a they when they first land they find these big pits with fresh dirt just , lacking ship technology and unable to lure passers by, they were of no use.

The village has a few locations:

Longhouse \- the enormous fire pit contains the remains of many children,

Worship altar \- Digging below the altar, or breaking the altar apart, will reveal the Moai Helm, described below.

Moai Ko Te Riku \- this status stands gazing over the village.

Huts \- Scattered about the village, often posted over hearths, there are miniature versions of the Moai heads that will bring curses if taken and kept. 

Napopo identifies his mother by a necklace, and rather unceremoniously takes her skull only. 

The party must make camp, or suffer Night Travel over lava flows.

Overnight strange creaking and dragging noises are heard, but there is no attack. If the PCs check in the morning, every single skeleton is oriented towards their camp, at the edge of the village, with clear soil disturbance indicating movement. If they camp inside the village, some awake with skeletal hands at their throats, unless the watch spots the influx.

The party sees tall statues in the distance. Along the way they come upon [Ana Te Pahu](http://johnsantic.com/cruising/galap_easter/visit_ei_land/pahucaves1.html), the resting cave Napopo seeks, which contains former cave dwellings and burial places. Inside things are very, very dark. [Red scoria](https://www.jstor.org/stable/24026301?seq=1) is found within, which Napopo grinds and sprinkle upon his mother's skull until it is fully covered.

When that is done the party may venture to the nearby statues. psychic phenomena. Learning. This is on the coast. The hermit can explain that the statues were meant to charm passing ships to appease god and bring visitors, but never worked.

As the party examines, their ship suddenly rounds a point. The aftcastle has massive damage. The sailors are shouting and waving, and a ship's boat is rowing mightily to shore. Then a vast Moai Ahu Tongariki rounds the point, wading in the water to its chest. The Moai they are standing beside comes to life and pins somebody down. They must free, then run for it. As the slow moving Tongariki approaches the ship, the PCs must replace the exhausted rowers and make for the ship.

\*\* A Moaito (tiny Moai) will sneak into packs and board the ship, to cause chaos later. See Scenario 4\. Learning to strip down and search everything for simulacrums must become SOP.

**Environment**  
Night Travel \- travel on the island has walking dangers, which normally one can avoid except at night.

- volcano slope: Save vs falls and twisted ankles.  
- Lava flows: A fall will cut up the person, even stab them, and tend to make their hands cut and useless.

**Items**  
**Moai Helm** \- A very heavy lead helmet shaped like a Moai, but wearable by a person. It provides no way to see, makes the wearer very clumsy, but gives near immunity against Corruption while worn.

Henton		\- with Quintus, plumb the depths of the thinning of the veil  
Lucius		\- 

**MiniMoa**  
Tier 5, Health 12-4 (but only deactivates)  
Armor 4

- Affixes to the floor like a bollard  
- Breaks bones with its head \- actually just does damage, and after the battle you can perceive that it isn't real. \+2 damage instead.  
- Punch you suffer half your damage, or weapon damage  
- Interpose+1 to take damage

**Achmed (with Henton)**  
Also, his murdered brother Achmed (who Henton tethered) fears him too much to possess him. Henton can, of course, force him and gain a Black Point. Once he does this, his relationship is shackled forever.

**Omar the Turbaner**  
Tier 6, Health 26-12-8

Omar is not out of the fight yet. He has a pet Golem Moa that has Armor 5, can grip and crush for 4 damage, is strong enough to batter through steel. He wears it under his turban.

- Possession  
- Blindness  
- Intention prediction  
- Dagger: 1 armor penetration, 3 damage

The engineer is also no longer possessed, so what will become of him? He doesn't know that his attempt to smash the ooron would have failed, but it would have.

The hundred rooms actually have the remnants of civilization in them: the islanders who, once prosperous, traded with the Zocto before they were Logans-Runned into feeding their spirits to the Moa.

**Moa**  
The Moa, former Jovian slaves, for their part are blameless. They're just trying to keep from going extinct, and using human spirits is their only option. They are still compelled to travel to Jupiter and serve.

The gate to Jupiter leads to the ring cities, but you can only stay a while (a week?) Before soul separation.

**TABLET 1**

- Find a toppled Moai. It can barely move:   
  We carve. We sculpt. It is for the future. The prestige of our tribe.  
  Willingly we go to the Ahu.  
  Gladly we lay down, and suffer without food for thirty days.  
  Gladly are we purified.  
  Gladly made clean.  
  Many years my people believed. Willingly we put ourselves to the knife, all for the promise of eternal existence. And it was true. Vigor undimmed by the passage of time.

We thought our enemy was the Orophagians.  
We did not escape enslavement, we were being bred.  
Eternal life, but only by the will of the Most Sublime Lord.

**TABLET 2**

- Ioan: "The People of the Fiery Moon"  
- Zocto: "The People of the Frozen Moon"  
- Moai: "The cudgel of God"  
- We are the Moai and we are powerful. We escaped from the Enslaver. Long he wielded us as a cudgel, against the Ioans. Their mechanical bodies made them formidable enemies. But our stone bodies are unyielding. Never can we produce another, for we do not originate Spirit. We dwindled.  
  But when we prevailed it was as if we had awakened, and we saw how we were used for the purposes of the Lord Sublime. And the Ioans , now defeated, he enslaved as well.  
  Far we traveled, through the gate, an escape we believed that we engineered. Years upon years we lived in peace with the soft, vulnerable natives of our new home. We were at peace.  
  And then the Orophagians appeared. Warpers of minds, of spirits, of the very essence of what makes a sentient a sentient. In self defense, and with a good will, we made more mighty Moai, and allowed their spirits to enter in and dwell within.  
  Against the Orophagians this was a mighty defense. They were powerless against those who had changed, but crafty. Hard to find...  
- NOTE: the Cult of Purity is the start of humanity voluntarily serving the Corruptor.  
- NOTE: The Orophagians are the architects of human genetic alteration.  
- NOTE: Orophagians are manifestations of the Second Ward, serving Orongo.  
- Orophagian encounter: At village they appear in doorways. Move from house to house.

2. **Petroglyphs** [PIC](https://i0.wp.com/imaginarapanui.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/North-group-094.jpg?resize=610%2C408&ssl=1) \- The rocks around the village are covered with more than 1,700 petroglyphs, the highest concentration of rock art on the island. Touching them gives you a vision as from a bird high above the crater, slowly moving. Touching them intentionally brands your had with indentations of the bird men, making you vulnerable to their mind tricks.  
3. **Rookery** \- of the andromorph bird men  
   1. Hundreds of them, wrapped in water-dripping Jovines.  
   2. More, nestled in wound Jovines upon the lake bottom, slowly transforming. There are **tens of thousands** of them

3. Seem to be this: [PIC](https://cdna.artstation.com/p/assets/images/images/030/914/286/medium/lukasz-cywinski-swamp-ruins2.jpg?1602028307) Ancient buildings slump tipped in the watery center of the crater.  
   4. With Reality Discipline it is actually this: [PIC](https://cdn.suwalls.com/wallpapers/fantasy/village-in-a-tree-17098-1920x1080.jpg). Warped bird men fly about, serving their Morph Priest masters, armed with poisoned blowguns and Jovine lassos.  
4. Should confronting Orongo involve  
   1. travel to Venus  
   2. thence to the London Bridge [link](https://imgur.com/gallery/W2H3uX2). If so, you can only stay mere minutes through the far side of the gate (a "second passing"  
5. **Documentorium**  
   1. **Studies of First Passing** \- Written in French, it describes the effects of passing a gate, how your soul is slowly ripped away, and the palliative effects of wrist torques.  
   2. **Minutes of the Council of Changers**.(in french)  
      1. Why they picked George as the Eighth Ward. **George the Third** was particularly chosen because of his strong resistance to the ward of subjugation, and his signature in 1807 banning slavery.  
      2. Kidnapping and replacement with a simulacrum.  
   3. **Blank Book** (Constance) (History of the Andromorphs).

   * Inside is the coffin with George III [PIC](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1013876930451349504/1096989804719255654/Jeesty_hr_giger_white_casket_b4e66737-ddc2-44a5-bb2d-1916859e1d21.png)	 [PIC](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1013876930451349504/1093709929233268796/Jeesty_a_beautiful_young_roma_fortune_teller_from_1800s_london_13cdadae-2b18-4704-9d0b-e3284c30db14.png). The true George, not the insane simulacrum.  
   * The coffin is a living thing, woven of spirit thread and leather-like . A servant of the Corruptor.  
   * Saving George means to Orongo that he must go destroy the civilization of Great Britain.  
7. **Lake** \- in the lake is Orongo, warped and twisted. Looks like the lake bottom, strangely rippled. Orongo is wrapped around the ruins, and will rise up.  
   1. When he stands all the vine-wrapped andromorphs will rise with him.

## Andromorph society

**Andromorphs** \- have their own tribal tree culture, dominated by the Tangata (bird men). They have their own complex political and rulership structures, each pseudo-species with its own. For the Tangata they honor the Tangata Manu, who runs a parallel organization to the Morph Priests, like the way the mob ran Sicily during foreign occupations.

**Morph Priests** \- The morph priests are feared, and allowed to pass unharmed, but nobody "loves" them because they inflicted this suffering on the Andromorphs. They run compulsory prayers to Orongo once a week.

## Tangata Kau

The Tangata Kau is an annual competition to retrieve a sooty tern egg first and become Tangata Manu, or the political and spiritual leader of the Tangata bird man andromorphs. For purposes of this adventure, four types of Andromorphs participate: Bird Men, Fish Men, Bat Men, and Iguana Men (based on sea iguanas).

### Introduction

1. When they see commotion on the tree, Mariso reveals that it is preparation for the Tangata Manu, where each clan may send a Hopu, or Champion to compete  
2. Even though they are bitter enemies, her village has seven clans, and the ancient right to send Hopu from each. All comers are granted safe passage on the day of the competition.  
3. Moira discusses with Mariso, and says they can use the sympathy magic of a Champion and retrieved egg to ease aversion to the players when accompanied by the Hopu. But they can't much change the Morph Priest sentiment, except to make the non-Hopu players "harder for them to see".  
4. With Mariso and a "white flag" the players may present Hopu \- chosen champions \- to compete.

### Competition

Gathering with all the assembled andromorphs, the players must cooperate to overcome nature, [Orca](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ml4MhMjmapNTFYD-ifeZb_XncwotmAcRF9zSmtC7zb0/edit#bookmark=id.r6xpkc3ld3k2), sharks, and rival Hopu to emerge victorious. This will become clear as each species shows their advantages.

Per their nature, Orca will try to "help", all the while attacking with painful head bumps (that push the players forward, but hurt them), tossing the players (forward), and sometimes biting and dragging them through the water (forward). They might butt sharks or other Hopu, to stop them, but to little effect.

1. Hopu must:  
   1. Leap from the cliff. Bird men and bat men will appear to have it in the bag here.  
   2. Swim through shark infested waters to **Moto Nui.** Someone will be attacked by Orca, while a few andromorphs perish to sharks. Fish men excel here.  
   3. Arriving at the island, the skies open with pelting frigid rain. It is the advent of the long-feared ice age brought on by Tambora.  
   4. Gather a sooty tern egg. harder than it sounds; might have to fight over it  
   5. Swim back \- others with eggs   
   6. Climb the sea cliff of Rano Kau  
2. The andromorph Hopu have advantages.  
   1. Bird men can glide farther in the initial cliff jump.  
   2. Fish men suck at the cliff, but are amazing in the water  
   3. Bat men both glide (flying is dishonorable) and can climb the cliff well  
   4. Iguana men swim well and find eggs with their sense of smell  
   5. **The Artist appears and helps a hero. The Explorer too.**  
3. They must must swim hard to the little island with the first 

**INVOLVE edward the confessor.**

**Language** \- the Rapa Nui language spoken in Hitorangi is called Rapanui or Pascuan. The Andromorphs have adopted than language. Here are a few important phrases:  
All praise the Birdman \- Hono i te Tangata Manu

**Beliefs** \- Priests promote these beliefs:

* All andromorphs are warped because they deserved it due to misdeeds in like  
* The morph priests simply bring the justice of god to humanity  
* Orongo is god  
* Orongo died for their misdeeds, and they owe it to Orongo to serve him

PLOT

- It starts raining every couple of days. The sky dims further. It gets a bit colder. A little ice age is beginning (which Tambora and the Mariners will help solve)  
5. **Disguise**: The Coven must "disguise" them with Reality Warp. But they need something expressly native, and Sooty Tern eggs will do.  
   1. **LUCIUS** \- saw a crazy looking bird man with giant feathers glued to his arms and body, wearing a beak mask. All the warped man were deferring to it.  
   2. Mariso \- it is the time of the the Tangata Manu.  
   3. Andromorphs have their own tribal tree culture, dominated by the Tangata (bird men). The morph priests are feared, and allowed to pass unharmed, but nobody "loves" them because they inflicted this suffering on the Tangata., somewhat separate from the morph priests who don't exactly rule them, but are revered as religious figures. So anyone who becomes Tangata Manu will be able to pass unmolested.  
6. **Tangata Manu**  
   1. One of them must become the Tangata Manu, or Birdman by winning the annual Tangata Kau competition.  
   2. R.W. is a mild form of dark magic, so afterwards the witches will all be old, weakened magically.  
7. **Rano Raraku** \- the "big tree"  
   1. The players must enter the tree, reach it's center where George is.  
   2. The whole underside fo the tree is hollowed out. Just roots handing and twisting in space through a HUGE dug-out area.  
   3. They'll see where the books came from, see where the coffin used to be. Except that when Lucius escaped they freaked out and moved **George**.  
   4. The trail will lead deep into the mines and back to the Moa Deeps. George has been taken through the gate to Venus.   
8. **Hanga Rara** \- the deep tree mines  
   1. Below the tree is all hollow, with weaving roots you can walk on like paths.  
   2. An **andromorph "hive"** thrives among the roots of Rano Raraku, where the Andromorphs mine for incredibly rare Ooron crystals. The mines are woven with unexplored volcanic tubes, as well as hollowed out roots of Rano Raraku. Such mining is extremely dangerous.  
   3. Unrefined Ooron Crystals can be found at the base of extinct volcanoes due to the former presence of lava and high pressure.   
   4. A connecting tunnel leads to the Moa Deeps mines.  
9. **Lava Tube (leading to Moa Deeps)**  
   1. [PIC](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1013876930451349504/1098771044065611876/Jeesty_lava_tube_1800s_mine_ragtag_base_dim_lighting_03277a2c-c802-4ca8-aee1-c8959c73ea35.png?width=697&height=697)   
   2. Stritchers along the way  
10. **Moa Deeps Mines**  
    1. At the very bottom of that spiral entrance ramp is the entrance to the mines.  
    2. They are mined out now. No more Ooron to be discovered. But the falling apart decrepit mine tunnels are still there, haunted by \<creatures\> and an alliance of fled Andromorphs who live in a desperate commune and all see eachothers as equals. They dream of destroying the morph priests, but lack any real power.  
11. **See**   
12. **Ballrooms**  
    1. **Some of the nobles have shape changes. They seem to accept them. Siz fingers, an extra nose. Always very symmetrical.**  
13. **Venus**  
    1. Visiting Venus along the way (is George taken there?). Does the tree gate (unguarded) lead to a Venusian room with the heavily fortified gate to the Moa Deeps?  
    2. Syzygy pressure suits are needed to retake George from Venus or Jupiter. Perhaps the Artist comes to them; did the Explorer return to him after he left them in Moa Deeps?  
14. **George III**  
    1. Kept in an ancient Venusian temple. Guarded by ??  
15. Orongo  
    1. Angered by the freeing of the King, Orongo will awaken and rampage towards London to destroy it.  
    2. Does he eradicate the failed Shaping experiment in favor of reigniting all the volcanos on the island? Is the Ward at Tambora using the entire Ring of Fire to Ice Age the earth, and can all that energy be harnessed by the players and ghosts of the Mariners to generate the New God?

Joseph Bonaparte will invite the Spirit Master to breakfast to learn what he can, without giving too much away.

* That meeting might reveal how the party has been identified by George as critical to the war, and Henton in particular, as spirits trump weaponry any day.

**2023-05-04**  
They have the Kumasi Shaman in their power.

- He thinks of the Corruptor as the "Jungle King"   
- He rejects modernism. He thinks humanity's straying from being natural is bad.  
- He has over 100 beads, all with the spirits of shackled children. He also carries a "letter of reference" from Joseph Bonaparte.  
- Kitchen, Storage; The windows look to be 1.5" thick.  
- He knows where the coffin was taken. He t  
- The locals have custom, personal spirit thread duds for brief trips.  
  - Guillaume  
  - Two spirits masters  
  - What to serve Robert Jenkinson's group  
- The spirit thread suits they have are not cuttable with normal means. One imbues one's hands with tethered spirits. To really unravel it you need something of gold.  
  - The threads fade after a bit, but are rejuvenated when they walk through the membranes  
  - They have a silver spirit thread leading straight up (to a Soul Collector)  
- They have an hour glass  
- They need to pretend to be the British delegation from British prime minister Robert Jenkinson  
- They will risk getting holes in their suits if they go head-on  
- Joseph Bonaparte is the guy here.

ALSO:

* They discover a disc in the navigation table of their ship similar to the one Tuktu found buried in the ice years ago. It seems these are standard navigation devices used by the early Zocto.  
* Constance has a vision of the Goat Headed Man (Captain Van Wooten) saying "

**2023-04-01**  
Constance, just rode an orca 35 mph, all clothes and weapons gone. At island crawling out of water.  
Throckmorton \- connection to first orca with 8 successes. Got the superior vibe. Halfway between within 100' of the island  
Henton \- near Throck. Connection to spirit of the Orca. Got its age. Got it's positive "a blow against the malign\!" attitude. Standing on island.  
Bolton \- at midpoint island. Scared off an andromorph.

7 orca are around. About half the andromorphs are dead.

3 fish men on island  
2 lizard men on island  
\<eggs have been pre-hidden by the bird men\>

**2023-03-??**  
\- Vines down the throats (and in the lungs) of Gahan and Henton; Both are headed to 1/2 Might.  
\- They haven't figured out how to deal with this, but the blue mushroom and tea might have some impact.  
\- Gahan at 0 int.  
\- They just saved Gahan from being a fetus on the flanks of Orongo.

**2023-03-??**

* They discover a Coven of Five Witches. Meriwa communicated to Moira in a dream.  
  * The coven is  
    * Moira  
    * Meriwa of the Netsilik  
    * Mariso of the Hitorangi  
    * Lavinia Aethelind the Gypsy Fortune Teller  
    * Ekua the soothsayer from Cape Coast Castle.  
* **A flavorful treat for everyone**

  * Did they make the library books available somehow?  
  * Are they key to completing a portal to Syzygy to retrieve the environment suits?  
* Encounter: Skritcher Swarm

**2023-02-??**

* They are at the Moai gate leading to Jupiter.  
* Because of their andromorph tattoos from the stones Lucius and Gahan were taken by the hands and lead to the Hatchery.  
* They saw a Moai walk into the Jupiter gate, along a pathway cleared on the lake bottom (Orongo's body)  
* Henton lost his Moai as it walked, by itself, through the gate to Jupiter  
* WE need to figure out what happens, exactly, when yo go to Jupiter.

The party just used a laser to vaporize a stone door that trapped them inside a round village hut.

* Morph priests will continue to appear as shadows inside the huts, luring the players inside.  
* But the next such door will be imbued with Spirit, and thus invulnerable to the laser. Henton might entice it, or Lucius might evict it.  
* Also, it might give the clue that enspirited creatures can no be harmed by the green rod of light.

They saw a Moai walk across the lake bottom (which is the skin of Orongo the Changer).

Rapid processing: easement to all speed checks, and take an extra action for one round.

* Vines: Health 8, DC 5 attacks, DC 6 to yank from Orongo (instant kill)

**Portal Gates**  
You can move from one planet to another through a gate and stay there for a number of days without fear. But if you move through a second gate your soul will slowly rip apart from your body. The other restriction on getting is of course when the gate is destroyed on the far end, but the doctor defensive shield for example keeps the enemy at Bay from getting out of Jupiter and on to Earth for very long.

Therefore the bonapartists can get from Elba to Venus, and have balls and dancing there, but they cannot stay long in the further gate that leads for example to the moa deeps

## The Bonaparte Plot "The New Empire" {#the-bonaparte-plot-"the-new-empire"}

It is black, as if soaked in ink.

The French are working with Orongo to warp the mind of King George completing his madness and reshaping him as the 8th ward.

When that is complete he will dissolve the English Continental Monarchist alliances, invalidate the Congress of Vienna, reinstall Napoleon as emperor of France and Marshall of England. Napoleon will then use the British Navy and French Army to re-take America, conquer all of Europe, and institute a New Empire spanning most of the world.

**George the Third** was a rather enlightened king. Read here:

https://time.com/6115140/george-iii-americas-last-king-tyrant/

**Henton**  
Will be given the opportunity to put his compatriots into the bodies of moai, if they go voluntarily then they can believe but it won't be true that they can keep their corporeal forms. The truth is they will become malai, but they will gain incredible powers:

* Invulnerability  
* long life  
* incredible strength  
* the ability to survive in vacuum and in the harsh environments of Jupiter.

But there will power, while it will seem to be their own until the critical moment when they go against the wishes of the corruptor, we appear to be their own.

## Dark Powers {#dark-powers}

You keep making all your own choices, but when a moment comes that you don't voluntarily do something that the corruptor really cares about:

* the Game Master rolls a d6.  
* For each evil thing that you have done, that is stepping through the wide Open door into the void, it is one more level of difficulty.  
* When the game master rolls better than your tear, then you get a chance to roll using effort and so forth to try to resist doing that thing.  
* This lasts forever until you purify yourself, and of course every attempt at purification is against the will of the corruptor so you must make successful roles to purify.

It is, and is intended to be, a slippery slope towards losing your volition.

Regarding the revolutionary war:

**George 3 in Real Life**  
George not taking part in grand strategy-making, and going along with Cabinet decisions as a constitutional monarch. He limited his involvement in the war to advising, encouraging and occasionally warning, whereas Lord North oversaw the defeat, Lord George Germain came up with the overall strategic plan, Sir William Howe failed to stick to it, General Burgoyne got himself captured at Saratoga and General Cornwallis at Yorktown. They deserve the blame for the defeat,

**United States**  
Regarding destruction of the 5th ward:  
America is in chaos, as slaves are released willy nilly by their owners, the economy of the South collapses, and England begins designs to retake the colonies
