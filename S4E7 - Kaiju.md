​​As they are climbing up the bones of turned black, and soon they will become so fragile that every bone you break will just make a bunch of Ash which if you breathe it in causes bad luck. The whole purpose of this Tower is that it is the chrysalis of King George III being turned into the 8th ward. The spirits are receiving the power from the Jovian 8th storm at the South Pole. Henton or others will realize that there are morsels here not attached to the shaper, but rather being used to transform King George into the 8th ward.

Find also the first altered venusians, zocto, ioans, mariners, etc in the bone tower.

**There is a critical moment when the Second Ward is brought to half strength.**

- **At that point everyone feels a shudder through their spirit.**  
1. **Now ward can Change every mook in a single round, not only altering them into Andromorphs, but driving them temporarily mad. Gold helmets will resist this; DC7 will change the witches**  
2. 

Probably want to clarify rules about Hentons spirits first, and Bolton's strength.

* Pangolin armor gives Henton an animal spirit companion.  
* Lucius appears beside the king. He believes in the cause;  deus ex machina moment where Lucius is stopped/harmed/killed.  
* George must call upon Bolton as if nothing untoward has happened. But this time the jig is up, and the party will be captured and travel in the second ward towards London.

Soult needs to reappear, leading Adapted in support of George

* Soult's Adapted get a light cavalry \- riding Venusian Bearers which waterbug skate across the ocean. His cavalry leader is Marshal Murat.  
* Venusian Master  
* Venusian Bearer

Ziggurats. The theme of ziggurats needs to repeat. George's shoulder building re-shapes into a ziggurat. Jupiter needs to have them. Hundreds, raised above the planet is the storm's edge ring cities.

The shaking hand king,who feels his age, is using all his willpower to warp the mind of his Shaped alter ego. 

* That mind sees the party as converted, the black marks in Constance and Henton as sufficient and the others as weak enough to have fallen.  
* It has insisted to Napoleon that they are critical to success, and points to the killing of the fifth ward as proof, and in fact that disrupting the American Colonies was intentional.

In a clear moment he will say "does your ship have might armament? Make it so"  
And later "We must not reach London. You will know the signs to act."

He will be taken by the second ward across the sea. They should use their new ship, implosion torpedoes. Perhaps even ramming. Almost certainly engaging the Mariner (orca) if they can somehow (spiritually) clear their minds. The orca will take mighty bites of the second ward.

Can the finale here include:

Gahan sneaking into x to steal  
Bolton commanding the ship.  
Henton dueling the Ward (and seeing a glimpse of the possibility of a new god, or the deep laid plans of the mariners to turn Jupiter into a new sun, destroying the Corruptor)  
Throckmorton freeing the orca's minds  
Constance assassinating the king?

In the next session the king will get into a few state and I think that being the real King he will make it clear that he is fighting for them to not be noticed and not be killed and instead doing everything he can to make it appear as if they are on his side. Also there might be an incident where one of the doctor is captured and executed by the Iowans. And I think perhaps there should be some kind of Revelation that it is the long-term slow destruction of humanity that is going to be the issue, and that one of the paths to that is technological improvement. For example by plague where the plague is introduced technology saves people and then it is withdrawn or disabled and people are wiped out. Or by overheating and over pollution. Or by one of the many potential apocalypses

Marie Walewska, Napoleon's former Polish lover and a Polish patriot at a time when Poland was fully occupied, needs to be a witch. She appears at an opportune moment.

If the ward manages to grasp a Bolton it will bring it him to the pavilion with King george. King George will seem to just start to recognize that perhaps Bolton is acting against him, as the last wisps of the original mind of King George fade. But a convincing performance by Bolton will stall the inevitable full throttle attack of the ward. Therefore it is worthwhile to keep the king alive as long as possible, but the second ward can never die as long as the king lives because it will transfer itself into him

The proper tactic for fighting the ward with the ship is to be sailing past and swing your nose towards it while you move past as quickly as possible. But of course it is. There are many strategic opportunities to use the various torpedoes in the correct orders and configurations and ways in order to gain advantages.

In addition to creating confusion, the spirit disruption torpedoes will create holes in the spirit thread layer enabling the disintegration torpedoes to penetrate.

We might want to hint the players to really think about the tactical opportunities. I would say that Bolton and constants are both likely to give that some thought.

It might be interesting if the ward manages to snap the mask, which would basically Force the players to try to stay far away from it for a while, take rest, restock and reevaluate their situation. It might also give them time to think.

The ship has some limitations it can go basically to the height of the warts head in normal flight. But going to hire altitudes slowly consumes t

he existing charge of the huron. After some time doing that that Iran cell will need time to reinvigorate itself, which it automatically does

The orcas can basically kill about 25% of the andromorphs that are below. It will take a great deal of time because they will constantly have to be fighting their way out of being grabbed by roots, but they can do it. They can also make tremendous leaps from the sea to get andromorphs on the lower 25% of the word above the water line in their jaws.

There's a very important tension around ranging. If you shoot from too far away you are wasting your incredibly precious and limited resource of torpedoes and missiles. If you shoot from too close you're going to get grabbed. But if you are moving past you can have around during which you are close and suffer attacks but then can break away to a safe distance again

Be very clear with the players about how that works. Every hundred rounds loses you some of your aim and ability to hit. So they probably want to maximize that. And I imagine that sooner or later your weapons officer and pilot are going to run out of points to spend

Clarify Rules

- Henton Spirits  
- Bolton Strength

Day 0  
Upon return to the vicinity of the tree:

- It is currently evening. The party is trying to figure out where the ward "is"  
- Henton saw every andromorph like a small nuclear reactor with dark force "pushing" sentient and animal spirits together  
- See the "shrine" snake out white tendrils, then lift upward into the tree. It becomes apparent it is a mind  
- Spirits  
  - All tethered spirits get agitated. Something is coming  
  - Human spirits feel the anvil (black marks feel it more)  
- Andromorphs start  
  - Diving from the tree branches or walking into the swamp, to be envined  
  - Their spirits are absorbed into the tree.  
- Travel Tests  
  - DONE Stair redirects downward  
  - DONE Stair closes off  
  - DONE Wood closes in  
  - Path around the edge of the outside  
- Note: how is this different, really, than soldiers being consumed by war to strengthen their elite masters?  
- At Ship  
  - Beard has been training them relentlessly  
  - An attempt was made by flying andromorphs to steal the sphere \- the forcefield mostly kept them out

Ancient Sites  
The ward will move to a number of ancient sites. Five in all. It can absorb restless spirits from those sites, places where ancient cataclysm eradicated many.

Village Defense  
It is clear the ward is greedy for more souls, and will jovine the entire village if it can.  
The ward will depart if the effort isn't worth more souls than it loses health.

- How do the players make a difference?  
- Henton can reinforce the spirit wards with his own spirits. If they get the Soul Sphere there and crack it open that works.  
- One or both witches will be wounded or killed.  
- There is a portal near the village \- Robespierre appears ushering a hoard of Tupilak which climb up into the Second Ward (to be fought later).  
- Saving it reveals the Mariso has two stashed Ooron modules.

### Sequence

Setting \- the sky darkens with clouds and ash. An unnaturally cold, pelting rain comes on and doesn't stop.  
It is 1am \- King appears next morning at 5am

* Ancient Sites 1, 2  
* Village  
* Sky darkens, air colder  
* Ancient site 3  
* Summon swimming Tupilak  
* Ancient Sites 4, 5  
* King escorted by hundreds of Adapted  
* Get King  
* Revive Terevaka volcano. Sky blackens. Day becomes night. Ash rain. Lava rolls towards Hitorangi buying time for the Ward to reach the Easter Shaft over and through water.  
* Sea journey to the Earth Shaft first over water, then thru water to the sea floor opening  
* Journey to London via Easter shaft, center, Mariner Core, new shaft up towards Europe  
* To either a) to Giant's Causeway in Ireland, then overland to London, or b) Santorini (past the undersea ruins of Atlantis) and thence to Knossos on Crete

- Henton & Throckmorton with Mariso and Lavinia headed on broom to the village to defend against the Second Ward  
- George in a palanquin on the shoulder of the ward.  
  - He will be taken by the second ward across the sea.  
- Gahan is getting trained on the mech.  
- All sailing ship to the Poiketike underground harbor to get the torpedoes  
  - \*\* the ship can indeed fly. And it had compressed aid plus the torpedo compressed air it can fire air to ground.  
- Orongo will arise when the King shows up the next morning.  
- First take the village of Hitorangi for healing  
- Reveal a hoard of swimming Tupilak  
- Raid of Vesperna on the ship, trying to steal crew

**Roles**

* Gahan sneaking into mind of the ward to **steal the white thread core**  
* Bolton commanding the crew against root onslaughts and Jovine onslaughts.  
* Henton dueling the Ward (and seeing a glimpse of the possibility of a new god, or the deep laid plans of the mariners to turn Jupiter into a new sun, destroying the Corruptor)  
* Henton freeing the orca's minds to be savants (cost 1 exp?)  
* Throckmorton freeing the orca's minds to be animals (cost 1 exp?)  
* Constance assassinating the king?

**Tactics**

- Witches fly on brooms, snatching andromorphs at peril to their lives  
- Gahan ride-along with the Artist  
- Spirit Sphere can be used as a lure \- it wants it  
- Research \- Ekua might mention, or a party member recall, the Bantu origin of the 5th ward, and wonder why mighty kings are the "seed" of each ward. And who is the seed for the 2nd ward?  
- Engage up to five Orca [link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ml4MhMjmapNTFYD-ifeZb_XncwotmAcRF9zSmtC7zb0/edit#bookmark=id.r6xpkc3ld3k2) Mariners (spiritually clear their minds, DC 8\)  
- Implosion torpedoes  
- Missile-izing torpedoes  
- Ramming \- the ship will not be harmed, but it will end in close range  
- Dissolve \- learn the skill of unshaping \- dissolving the Sentient/Natural spirit anvil made by the ward. Results in spiritual explosion.  
- Lure \- the Spirit Sphere can be used as a lure

**Armory**

- It turns out that not all of the 40 torpedoes are implosion after all\!  
- \[\[\[ see battle tracker \]\]\]  
  - 2 / 10 implosion (radius 5m) \- black five little nozzles of compressed water  
  - 2 / 10 fire gel missiles (radius 5m) \- looks like a red gel. One big nozzle  
  - 10 disintegration (radius 5m) \- They don't know what this is.  
  - 5 spirit disrupters, blue sparkles in nose cone (radius 5m)  
  - 3 / 5 freezers \- The spirit disruption torpedoes essentially create blind spots where that part of the ward will not react to approaching people, so it helps you get close to it for whatever you want to attempt. It also means you can sell your ship passed in a close-up broadside if you've hit it prior.  
  - 

**After The Battle**

* Throckmorton can use the knitting needles to remove the Corruptor-induced reshaping, which was previously impossible. The rest of humanity must wait to reproduce (but some will spontaneously change).

- 

**Flying the Ship**

- Fly ship \- Gahan brings a human perception to the Zocto runes, and enabling Henton (archeology+decipher) to discover how to make the ship fly.  
- The Ship Spirit [PIC](https://photos.google.com/album/AF1QipOTCRxzAnMfLbdoomC6wG7EACkwMejJcUYW5-QD/photo/AF1QipN1gZBsw6uQayF_zpfUH9HsOj4X2uvsT32avtk-)  
-  The key is willpower  
  - Henton must awaken the slumbering Ship Spirit DC 9  
  - Bolton must **command** the spirit of the ship to fly DC 9  
  - Gahan must pilot, making Zocto phrase shapes on the controls  
  - Throckmorton must slot Ooron into the Flight Cradle correctly, at the right time  
  - Flight occupies an Ooron slot, making that power unavailable for any other purpose.  
  - Eventually Henton discovers he can delegate a spirit to Bolton to "translate" commands directly to the ship spirit, relieving Gahan from the controls

**2023-06-01**  
They're in quarters, bathing with their French maids. 

* They will receive gifts  
* Perfect dress clothes for everyone  
* Optional french face paints  
* The King **will try to convert them**  
* There are 10,000 Adapted lying on their backs on the plain, staring into the sky, as they rest for their next assignment. They don't breath, taste, speak or sleep. All their organs are shriveled.  
* Their suits have holes. Henton has his spirits back, so the spirit threads will slowly dissolve.  
* They next will be at the ball and see:  
  * Napoleon will make an appearance. The King will adore him.  
  * But the relationship is complex, because the King is partly converted to the 8th ward, of consumption and resource exploitation.  
  * The story of the Venusians will surface. "They heated their world, but we shall learn from their lesson" (but of course that is the plan \- to catalyze one of the apocalypses  
* 

**2023-05-25**  
Escorting King G3 from the dome. Spirit thread knit into holes, and a spirit, who must concentrate, acting as "anchor" for each person's patch. Henton did the patching. Henton's \[rolls\] are above.  
The King is currently lucid, but has a tremor in his left hand. He emanates a COMMANDING presence.

* The King's clothing is already woven with Spirit Thread, and Henton only had to do his head and hands.

King Styles

* **Clarity** \- an authoritative and commanding presence. He misses Kew Palace.   
* **Manic** \- His shaking hand indicates the onset. He will hallucinate that Constance is Queen Charlotte. Queen Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz, the wife of King George III of Great Britain, died on November 17, 1818  
* **Turned** \- He starts by bringing up how he has seen the light. The world is Britain's for the taking. A future of resource exploitation of the entire earth lies ahead. Technology will transform all. He will occasionally mumble and channels the second ward, and talk about killing himself.

What will they meet on the way back?

* A bog monster?  
* Scritchers lead by the Venusian that Gahan took the leg from?  
* A troop of Adapted? 

When they arrive at the Venusian Versailles he looks way better.

1. In a fit of vigor he hatches a plan to discover the Bonapartist plot, destroy Joseph Bonaparte, get Henton the secret of Spirit thread weaving, and put a dent in the Venusian Adapted.  
2. Or, he overcomes them with aura of command, and they become his entourage as he prepares to assume command of the empire. (Does he read minds, and learn of his son's work against the Corruptor)?  
   1. Jovines from inside the characters?  
   2. Tattoos from the rocks outside the crater?

**2023-05-18**  
They defeated the Adapted, who weren't too difficult.  
Now they must deal with the Sarcophagus. What exactly is inside? Is it the frail King George? Yes. But he has no suit\! Will they have to carry the sarcophagus? Knit a suit of spirit thread?

* American revolution  
* Industrial revolution  
* **DONE** Napoleonic wars  
* Agriculture output  
* Abolition of slave trade

He is covered in a cocoon like webbing, hooked to various tubes  
He seems frail but alive.  
The task is to carry him out of there.  
3x dark star grenades (-25% speed) \- implode in 3m radius, compacting all within

On the way out do they see archaeology? Or is that for another time?

All portals are housed in their own buildings, so that if a portal collapses the main building isn't harmed.

One of the early proponents of the weekend was British labor reformer Robert Owen, who in 1817 advocated for the "Eight hours labor, eight hours recreation, eight hours rest" model, which would come to be known as the 8-hour workday.

**When Orongo the Shaper rises**, if he needs it, he just kills vast swaths of the incubated that are on his body wrapped in jovines. The souls, newly freed, are relatively weak and disoriented, but horrifying due to the imminence of their death.

Maybe this is part of why all Kumasi died \- they were being drawn upon by the black opal king for power.

**2023-05-04**  
They have the Kumasi Shaman in their power.

- He thinks of the Corruptor as the "Jungle King"   
- He rejects modernism. He thinks humanity's straying from being natural is bad.  
- He has over 100 beads, all with the spirits of shackled children. He also carries a "letter of reference" from Joseph Bonaparte.  
- Kitchen, Storage; The windows look to be 1.5" thick.  
- He knows where the coffin was taken. He t  
- The locals have custom, personal spirit thread duds for brief trips.  
  - Guillaume  
  - Two spirits masters  
  - What to serve Robert Jenkinson's group  
- The spirit thread suits they have are not cuttable with normal means. One imbues one's hands with tethered spirits. To really unravel it you need something of gold.  
  - The threads fade after a bit, but are rejuvenated when they walk through the membranes  
  - They have a silver spirit thread leading straight up (to a Soul Collector)  
- They have an hour glass  
- They need to pretend to be the British delegation from British prime minister Robert Jenkinson  
- They will risk getting holes in their suits if they go head-on  
- Joseph Bonaparte is the guy here.

Constance, just rode an orca 35 mph, all clothes and weapons gone. At island crawling out of water.  
Throckmorton \- connection to first orca with 8 successes. Got the superior vibe. Halfway between within 100' of the island  
Henton \- near Throck. Connection to spirit of the Orca. Got its age. Got it's positive "a blow against the malign\!" attitude. Standing on island.  
Bolton \- at midpoint island. Scared off an andromorph.

7 orca are around. About half the andromorphs are dead.

3 fish men on island  
2 lizard men on island  
\<eggs have been pre-hidden by the bird men\>

**2023-03-??**

\- They haven't figured out how to deal with this, but the blue mushroom and tea might have some impact.  
\- Gahan at 0 int.  
\- They just saved Gahan from being a fetus on the flanks of Orongo.

**2023-02-??**

* They are at the Moai gate leading to Jupiter.  
* Because of their andromorph tattoos from the stones Lucius and Gahan were taken by the hands and lead to the Hatchery.  
* They saw a Moai walk into the Jupiter gate, along a pathway cleared on the lake bottom (Orongo's body)  
* Henton lost his Moai as it walked, by itself, through the gate to Jupiter  
* WE need to figure out what happens, exactly, when yo go to Jupiter.

The party just used a laser to vaporize a stone door that trapped them inside a round village hut.

* Morph priests will continue to appear as shadows inside the huts, luring the players inside.  
* But the next such door will be imbued with Spirit, and thus invulnerable to the laser. Henton might entice it, or Lucius might evict it.  
* Also, it might give the clue that enspirited creatures can no be harmed by the green rod of light.

They saw a Moai walk across the lake bottom (which is the skin of Orongo the Changer).

## The Bonaparte Plot "The New Empire"

It is black, as if soaked in ink.

The French are working with Orongo to warp the mind of King George completing his madness and reshaping him as the 8th ward.

When that is complete he will dissolve the English Continental Monarchist alliances, invalidate the Congress of Vienna, reinstall Napoleon as emperor of France and Marshall of England. Napoleon will then use the British Navy and French Army to re-take America, conquer all of Europe, and institute a New Empire spanning most of the world.

**George the Third** was a rather enlightened king. Read here:

https://time.com/6115140/george-iii-americas-last-king-tyrant/

**Henton**  
Will be given the opportunity to put his compatriots into the bodies of moai, if they go voluntarily then they can believe but it won't be true that they can keep their corporeal forms. The truth is they will become malai, but they will gain incredible powers:

* Invulnerability  
* long life  
* incredible strength  
* the ability to survive in vacuum and in the harsh environments of Jupiter.

But there will power, while it will seem to be their own until the critical moment when they go against the wishes of the corruptor, we appear to be their own.

**George 3 in Real Life**  
George not taking part in grand strategy-making, and going along with Cabinet decisions as a constitutional monarch. He limited his involvement in the war to advising, encouraging and occasionally warning, whereas Lord North oversaw the defeat, Lord George Germain came up with the overall strategic plan, Sir William Howe failed to stick to it, General Burgoyne got himself captured at Saratoga and General Cornwallis at Yorktown. They deserve the blame for the defeat,

* Rack of 10 ranged weapons

### 1\. Ooron Projector (Constance)

 [pic](https://cdnb.artstation.com/p/assets/images/images/027/388/919/large/paul-lee-handgun-sortapresentable.jpg?1591383876); one every four rounds. 14 damage. 3 rounds to charge, fire on 4th round. Two handed. 30' fist-sized cylinder. **Doesn't harm things with souls** or inhabited, but it will disintegrate everything else. Takes longer for denser things. Rock takes 2 rounds. Metal 3 rounds. Lead or gold 4 rounds. It gets thicker if held on for round 2, three, etc. Constant use beyond 5 rounds shuts it down for a two minute rest.

- After ten rounds it takes 20 rounds to cool.  
- 6 minutes used  
- 30 minutes of use

### 2\. Dark Pistol (in ship)

 [pic](https://cdnb.artstation.com/p/assets/images/images/004/321/205/medium/alexandre-coadou-arg-ablaster-pres1.jpg?1482406517). Can load with up to three **Dark Stars** at a time. Fire one per round, but carrying it suffers inertia. Two handed. Stuns or sends mooks to sleep everything in a 7m radius.

### 3\. Shoulder Launcher (in ship)

[pic](https://cdna.artstation.com/p/assets/images/images/014/239/542/medium/alexandr-fedotov-scgl-08.jpg?1543147765) **Charge up to 2 minutes**. Hurls whatever you put in the barrel, though weak things will be destroyed or come out as shrapnel. The thing inside is rifled. After 1 minute (200 yards) damage to user may accrue. Less than three rounds and the thing just wimps out. Then 2, 3, 5, 7, 10, 13, 17, and 20 damage on round ten. Beyond 1 minute it starts to overheat as well, burning the carrier 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, but damage does not increase. Any charge beyond one minute requires a ten minute cooling period. 

### 4\. Noisy cricket (Gahan)

[pic](https://cdna.artstation.com/p/marketplace/presentation_assets/000/577/726/large/file.jpg?1604531209) Consumes **Might** to generate walls of force, proportional to the opposition to the wall. Roughly 1 person can hold back 5 people.

### 5\. Opposition Projector (Gahan)

[PIC](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1013876930451349504/1086820955353010237/Jeesty_a_futuristic_handgun_that_uses_the_shooters_spiritual_es_3845f3ba-854d-492c-a7ee-5648faf98077.png) Consumes your speed to temporarily drain the movement of up to five others. As long as you do not move the effect happens on your enemies. However, if you move they are always permitted to act as quickly as you do.

Spend **one speed** to make an enemy three tiers below you move and act at half speed, plus one 1 for each additional tier up to but not beyond your tier.

### 6\. S-Gun (Gahan)

[PIC](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1013876930451349504/1098809043658735636/Jeesty_futuristic_ray_gun_1800s_regency_era_f78a962f-eb7b-4826-bd94-2e5bdfb14821.png) 1.5' long weapon. Two handed. While focused on a surface it turns a 6' radius surface frictionless, and basically cancels all incoming inertia

- **2 speed** per round  
- Makes the surface sparkle blue and white

### 7\. M-Gun (Throckmorton)

[PIC](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1013876930451349504/1098809047823683654/Jeesty_futuristic_ray_gun_1800s_regency_era_3b4488f4-dff5-46d2-9117-af5e1718a0ea.png) Filled with the spirit of a bramble.

- Consumes **1 int per round**. Must impale thumb on top spike.  
1. Pulls any wooden or plant-based material, like a very strong man  
2. Saw: Blue Can cause shot things to sprout thorns \- wrapping somebody does 4 per round.  
3. Saw: Yellow-blue Can grab an pull with a spirit bramble (or hurl)  
4.   
5. 

### 8\. Q- Gun (Henton)

[PIC](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1013876930451349504/1098812008729673769/Jeesty_futuristic_ray_gun_1800s_regency_era_streamlined_crystal_961d258b-c168-473a-9b8e-822928f8bfff.png)  
Has a spirit. It **pulls a spirit away**, temporarily, from a living host. Temporarily disabling them. To take the spirit at that moment is an **evil act**. **4 int.** Very sensitive to what you're using it for, so even slight transgressions will "open a door".

* 

### 9\. K-Gun (Constance)

[PIC](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1013876930451349504/1098812115973849129/Jeesty_futuristic_ray_gun_1800s_regency_era_streamlined_crystal_27fe0b9d-badb-4275-8b23-1d46ddd1628c.png) The glass tip gets incredibly hot. **2 speed** to initiate it, then 2 speed per round. It is actually a hand to hand weapon. It **penetrates 4 armor**, and does 8 damage in a round.   
**Dark Star powered**, but the one loaded into it doesn't slow you.

### 10\. F-Gun (Constance)

[PIC](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1013876930451349504/1098814136806293625/Jeesty_futuristic_ray_gun_1800s_regency_era_made_for_an_octopus_c089aa5d-7d65-40a1-839a-9de9700d9cee.png) Produces an obscuring smoke. It coats you and gives you resistance to mental attacks.  
You wind it up for two rounds. Shoot, and **wind back up for 1 round**.  
Use **2 int to fire** it at and grab mid-sized objects. If you grab onto it. Used as a vertical grapple it will lift 1000 lbs.

- Punch you suffer half your damage, or weapon damage  
- Interpose+1 to take damage

**Achmed (with Henton)**  
Also, his murdered brother Achmed (who Henton tethered) fears him too much to possess him. Henton can, of course, force him and gain a Black Point. Once he does this, his relationship is shackled forever.

**Omar the Turbaner**  
Tier 6, Health 26-12-8

Omar is not out of the fight yet. He has a pet Golem Moa that has Armor 5, can grip and crush for 4 damage, is strong enough to batter through steel. He wears it under his turban.

1. **Ballrooms**  
   1. **Some of the nobles have shape changes. They seem to accept them. Siz fingers, an extra nose. Always very symmetrical.**  
2. **Venus**  
   1. Visiting Venus along the way (is George taken there?). Does the tree gate (unguarded) lead to a Venusian room with the heavily fortified gate to the Moa Deeps?  
   2. Syzygy pressure suits are needed to retake George from Venus or Jupiter. Perhaps the Artist comes to them; did the Explorer return to him after he left them in Moa Deeps?  
3. **George III**  
   1. Kept in an ancient Venusian temple. Guarded by ??  
4. **Orongo**  
   1. Angered by the freeing of the King, Orongo will awaken and rampage towards London to destroy it.  
   2. Does he eradicate the failed Shaping experiment in favor of reigniting all the volcanos on the island? Is the Ward at Tambora using the entire Ring of Fire to Ice Age the earth, and can all that energy be harnessed by the players and ghosts of the Mariners to generate the New God?

**Robespierre**  
*Esteemed guests, I am Maximilien Robespierre, one time orchestrator of the French Revolution. We live in a world not merely of black and white but of a stormy sea of grays, where choices, though seemingly monstrous, may serve a greater good.*

*Our revolution was a fiery retort to centuries of absolute monarchy, a revolt borne of desperation. The Reign of Terror, as you call it, was a regrettable yet necessary step in forging a society from the flames of oppression. It wasn't born from a lust for blood but from the will to extinguish the flame of tyranny, even if it meant wielding the sword of fear.*

*I stand here vilified, yet unrepentant. I implore you, judge our revolution not by the guillotine's blade but by the enduring cry of 'Liberté, Égalité, Fraternité'. Each nation has its narrative, written with the ink of sacrifice and triumph. The French narrative was scribed with the blood of revolutionaries who dared to dream.*

*The path to liberty is often strewn with hardship, and we trod that path steadfastly. The dream of a better world sometimes necessitates a nightmare. We are all prisoners of our times, after all. Thank you for hearing this ghost from the past. Bonne soirée, mes amis.*

**Joseph Bonaparte**  
**Talks about the sad death of Josephine.**  
*Distinguished guests, I stand before you as the brother of Napoleon Bonaparte, a man whose vision extended beyond mere territorial gain. He sought to unite the world under an efficient code, breathing life into the Enlightenment's spirit, changing France, and establishing foundations of civil law globally.*

*Today, despite his confinement on Saint Helena, do not mistake his quiet for defeat. My brother is a storm waiting to break, his spirit unconquerable. The confinement of his body could not shackle the boundless resolve of his spirit. And soon he will be unshackled.*

*His ambition is as expansive as the cosmos itself. He dreams not only of earthly conquest, but also of the vast expanse of the solar system. May it sound absurd now, but remember his audacity has always defied odds.*

*So, watch for the dawn, for the return of the Napoleonic era is inevitable. His star, far from fading, is merely waiting for the right moment to illuminate the universe. The future holds more than just this world – it holds the conquest of the cosmos by the indomitable spirit of Napoleon.*

**Jean Soult**  
*Esteemed attendees, I am Jean-de-Dieu Soult, your Marshal of France. I acknowledge the criticism of my performance in Portugal and Waterloo and wish to clarify.*

*Victory and defeat in war result from circumstances beyond a single general's control. In Portugal and Waterloo, I faced complex terrain, distant from our homeland, formidable British forces, and unexpected Prussian reinforcements. Despite the challenges, I strived to serve France and Napoleon to the utmost of my abilities.*

*Now, adding insult to injury, a warship intended as a gift for Napoleon has been stolen from Le Havre's docks. This act is not just an affront to me but to all of France, a blow to our national pride.*

*Despite these trials, we must remember that our strength lies in our unity and resilience, not merely victories. Let's use these challenges to forge a stronger, more united France, and together, we will weather any storm.*

**Jean Stolen Ship**  
*Esteemed guests, as Marshal Jean-de-Dieu Soult, I stand before you with a heavy heart. Amidst the trials of war and the criticisms of my conduct, a recent incident has added insult to injury, one that concerns the audacious theft of a warship from Le Havre's docks.*

*This was no ordinary warship. This was a symbol of French craftsmanship, a vessel I had commissioned as a gift for the restored Bourbon monarchy, a token of respect for Louis XVIII. Its hull was clad in the finest copper, a testament to our nation's metallurgical prowess. Its wheel was a relic of history, the very one that guided Marco Polo on his legendary journey, secured from a museum as a spoil of war. Its sails, the finest silk, were meant to cut through the winds like a hot knife through butter.*

*And yet, it was taken. With a chilling audacity, the thieves maneuvered through the docks, opening the right gates at the right times, as if guided by a phantom hand. Adding to this audacious act, they had the gall to steal an art collection, a treasure trove of our cultural heritage that I had painstakingly curated to present to Louis. To say that I am infuriated would be an understatement.*

*Esteemed heroes of the British Empire, I appeal to your sense of justice and fair play. Our nations may have crossed swords on the battlefield, but I am certain that we can find common ground in the preservation of history and art. Let this audacious act serve not to further divide us, but to bring us together in the pursuit of justice. After all, are we not all custodians of our shared human heritage?*

**Talleyrand \- On Britain**  
In regards to Britain, Talleyrand's opinions might be mixed. On the one hand, he might appreciate the British for their role in defeating Napoleon, thereby facilitating the Restoration. On the other hand, Talleyrand was known for his belief in balance of power in Europe. Therefore, he could have some concern about the growing power of Britain, both in Europe and worldwide, especially after their victory over Napoleon.

**Talleyrand \- On Congress of Vienna**  
Concerning the Congress of Vienna, Talleyrand played a pivotal role as the representative of France. He successfully managed to secure a relatively lenient treatment for France despite the country's recent role as the aggressor under Napoleon. Talleyrand believed in a diplomatic balance of power and was instrumental in the formation of the Quintuple Alliance, which sought to maintain this balance. Thus, he would likely view the Congress as a necessary measure to ensure lasting peace in Europe.

**Talleyrand \- Bourbons**  
As for the restored Bourbon monarchy, Talleyrand had served as Foreign Minister under Louis XVI and was appointed again under Louis XVIII. While he may have had personal reservations about the competence and popularity of the restored monarch, he was generally supportive of the monarchy as a stabilizing force in France. Talleyrand was a pragmatist who believed in strong, stable governance, and would likely have seen the return of the Bourbons as a means to achieve this, even if it meant accepting certain compromises.

**Talleyrand \- On Napoleon**  
Dear Joseph, your brother, Napoleon, is a spectacle beyond our earthly confines. His audacious return from Elba is one thing; his alliance with a god, the establishment of a base on Venus, and the command of advanced weaponry quite another. Even for Napoleon, this is a grand stage.

Napoleon's genius, both administrative and military, is beyond doubt. He gave us the Napoleonic Code, a testament to his will to reform and modernize France. Yet, his insatiable ambition led us into chaos. His constant warfare, his desire for total control – these isolated us, fractured our unity.

Now, he stands in a ballroom on Venus, backed by a god, armed with weaponry of an advanced epoch. He has at his disposal the ability to travel straight to Paris through a gate, a power previously unimaginable. This could be a dawn of unprecedented progress or the onset of calamitous domination.

His godly backing and these extraordinary capabilities could be invaluable for France, advancing us beyond any nation on Earth, and indeed, in the solar system. Yet, his tendency for conquest, his dictatorial approach, brings a shudder of apprehension. Such power could uplift our nation or once again plunge us into the abyss of relentless warfare.

Joseph, your influence over him is now more critical than ever. A god stands with him, but it is our duty to ensure that he remains a leader for the people, not above them. We must ensure this power serves France, not a singular ambition. Let us tread this path of divine alliances and celestial bases with caution, lest we forget the earth we stand upon.

**Napoleon**  
He is persuading everyone \- George III, the players, the Russians.  
He is a spectre

*Ladies and Gentlemen, esteemed guests from Earth and beyond, welcome to this celestial ball. I stand before you, Napoleon Bonaparte, not merely as the former Emperor of France, but as the harbinger of a New Empire, transcending earthly boundaries. We gather tonight on Venus, a testament to our collective strength and our shared future.*

*Through the grace of the Lord Sublime, the powerful being from the depths of Jupiter, we are blessed with capabilities never before seen in human history., thousands of brave men and women adapted to withstand the rigors of Venus, turning it into a stronghold of our expanding empire.*

*Tonight, I share with you the news of a remarkable alliance. Our brothers across the Channel, led by **George III**, have joined our cause. Welcome brethren\! Your formidable naval strength shall be redoubled with the New Fleet, ships unlike any seen on Earth. No seafaring nation will withstand its might. \[\[George hear hear\!\]\] We look forward to the day when you stand at the helm of all Earth, guiding her into the light.*

*Yet we must also honor our land forces, each a marvel in their own right, each a testament to our resilience and innovation.*

* *The Adapted, once men and women of flesh and blood, now leathery-skinned stalwarts, enduring the harsh landscapes of this planet, standing as a symbol of our adaptability and resolve.*  
* *The fiery mechanoids of Io, those remarkable beings of iron and flame, epitomizing the might of our New Industry.*  
* *The stoney Moai of Jupiter, a force as unyielding and steadfast as the planet they hail from.*

*And yet, our strength grows greater. As we speak discussions flourish with the mighty **Tsar Alexander**. The master of diplomacy, the visionary modernizing mighty Mother Russia, and yes, my own bane. It was Russia, and no other, that defeated mighty Napoleon in that deadly winter. True greatness\! And now we shall unite celestial forces with the strength of the 700,000-strong Russian army. Even mightier shall your domains grow, with Ports on the Mediterranean, the Black sea, the Pacific, and even celestial ports to the planets \[\[he has no idea how to do this\]\]*

*All these shall combine with the forces of Europe to be made one in the conquest of Planet Earth. Together, we will forge a new path for humanity, across the landscapes of the Système Solaire, under the banner of our New Empire.*

*My great **British** friends, I understand the greatness of your empire, the indomitable might of your naval fleets, your colonies spanning the globe. I respect your achievements, your resilience, your thirst for discovery.*

*The New Empire is not about eradicating the old, but about transcending our earthly boundaries. We offer a partnership, a chance for the lion to extend its reach to the stars. Your colonies already encircle the Earth; now, imagine them encircling the Système Solaire. Imagine British trade ships not only sailing the seven seas, but traversing the infinite cosmos. The commercial possibilities are as boundless as space itself.*

*Honored representatives of the **Qing** Dynasty, I stand before you today aware of the challenges you face on Earth. Population growth beyond the capacity of your agricultural economy, the menace of corruption, a decline in imperial authority. These are significant trials that burden your great dynasty.*

*Yet, history has shown us time and again that the Qing are no strangers to adversity. Your dynasty, vast and glorious, has always found a way to triumph. Today, I extend a hand of friendship and alliance, not to add to your burdens, but to offer a path that may alleviate them.*

*Our New Empire does not seek to impose, but to **share**. Share the fruits of mechanization that could support the Qing Dynasty's needs and help to resolve some of its present challenges. Yes, this alliance requires effort, commitment, even sacrifice. But what we offer in return... I see valiant men and women of the Qing Dynasty who could stand beside us as equals in this grand journey. In the spirit of fraternity, we share the gift of the mechanical arts, of knowledge, of Law over Despotism, a gift that will allow you to claim your rightful place in this new era.*

Stick: *The benefits of this partnership are enormous, but let us consider the alternative. As this New Empire rises, those who are unable to embrace the future may find themselves left behind. The tides of change are upon us, my friends. The few who adapt will flourish. Those who resist may face isolation for we can not grant citizenship to resistors.*

*But our conquest is not for power alone; it is a quest for a higher purpose. We shall propagate the ideals of liberty, equality, fraternity, which we hold dear, to all corners of the Solar System. Our New Empire will not be bound by the chains of religious dogma. We shall be free individuals united under a common purpose, to make humanity the rulers of the stars.*

*Remember, this is not my empire, this is OUR empire. Every one of you here tonight plays a role in shaping our shared destiny. The future is ours to seize. Look around you – look at what we have achieved together. The potential for greatness is within us all. Let us stride forth and make the Système Solaire ours, not merely to conquer, but to inspire and unite. Let us create a society that future generations will look upon with pride. A society of equality, fraternity, and freedom. Forwards, towards our shared destiny, towards the greatness that awaits us\!*
