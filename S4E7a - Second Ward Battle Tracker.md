All gates below Poiketike are gone, closed forever.  
A French crew, attempting to raise the ship, and trained on it's usage, remain. But they are despairing. Perhaps they have seen the Adapted, and their recoding has been undone due to proximity to the death of the Second Ward. So they see things anew.

**2023-09-28 STATUS**  
Constance killed the minotaur.  
Minos got degraded to himself  
Henton took the King "to abide for a while"

**2023-09-21 STATUS**  
Henton, Bolton and Throckmorton with Moira and Meriwa are crawling upward through tiny passages in the bone maze. They all can barely fit, and shimying backwards requires a DC 7 speed check.

The ship is in HUGE trouble. Completely wrapped in branches, some of which end in micro DNA manipulators, and Constance is being changed, along with most of the crew. Half the crew is dead, and three of six troublemakers.

Gahan roams free (unperceived by the ward, as usual), and with the Artist, has decided to bring green goo to the bodies of Henton (near Constance on the ship), Bolton and Throckmorton and Moira and Meriwa all near the prone king in the Ziggurat.

Meriwa became a

- The eye of the ward shines with s different light \- we want to wrap the players back together into the labyrinth  
- Will the ward destroy the ship while they are in the labyrinth?

It is the ward's "turn"  
The ward-king's head has been split by Bolton's lance

The Spirit Metaphor  
It reminds each person of their own childhood, in a dark wood, at a time that was very frightening.

- You can will things into existence. Bolton for example with a pipe. But you spend an int or more to get it.  
- Henton has advantage getting objects his spirits might already possess

Black stag for henton. Arrow through its eye. He saw the spirit, a sentient spirit, leave the body. It touched Henton and he has been able to see spirits ever since.

Abstract concept conveyance is the key.  
First writing is a hero story of a man defending his family against a tiger

**The Tower**  
Made of the skulls and bones, but most importantly the spirits, of every andromorph ever changed.

**The Maze**  
Meriwa roared and gave everyone a \+1 easement to everything they do in the maze.

The maze has NORMAL big passages that everyone can follow. But the difficulty is that there are little squeezy walking passages, and even crawling ones, and they can get ornate, and difficult, and feel entrapping.

**The maze isn't what matters.**  But you need to go through the intra-bone passageways.  
It goes up, then flattens, all the while getting smaller, until around a twist it simply ends.

Some of the bones still have marrow, especially when you squeeze into a small passage.

Bones turn black as you go upward. Become somewhat crumbly.  
**Instead of shattering, they crumble and can be breathed in**.

Bolton commanding on deck, grabbed by root  
Gahan piloting

Henton separated thread and made 1 wound.  
He is using ten Hitorangi plus his six.  
Throckmorton is the canonical tern, a ghostly man size manifestation. He can't be reshaped, or Jovined (the ward has discovered) but it might be able to do other things to him... He rolls DC3 to avoid roots and touch the remaining 25-8 terns to free them.  
Mariso's spirits make a "dome" over the village. It defends against spirit attack, and against certain physical attacks launched by magical creatures.

Gahan has learned to pilot the sub at \-1.  
Constance is searching the sub. Rolling a DC6 lets her roll on the "Discoveries" table.  
Bolton is commanding.

Lavinia will ask Bolton \- "What is the nature of men? Are they good? Evil? What about men draws the eye of the Jovian Beast?"

\*\* Gahan has become pilot, because of his Zocto configuration. Speed rolls.  
\*\* Throck can reach out to the canonical spirits of things. He bought flying skill. He is the canonical tern. 23 to do.
