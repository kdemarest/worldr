The critters that they saw crawling all over the per effects ship get onto their ship and begin to damage it drill holes in it infiltrate inside it and now as colony creatures they begin to attack the crew become almost impossible to exterminate. Throckmorton's powers he will have to reach out to it in order to get it to leave

In the Major Accelerator, thinking of Europa.

At 1G it would only take five days to reach Jupiter, and when you arrive you'd be going 1.3% of the speed of light.

The **Mariners** are the key to slowing. Harnessing them their nanotechnology can grip the clouds of Jupiter

**2021-01-18**

The group has given two Ooron to recover ships. They have Victoria et al on board. They need to head to Zanadu. If they go to London or Tambora they're extending the campaign duration.

Everyone has recovered.

* Constance has a Soul Spear (that Francis Bacon Used in the Breedery) that can damage spirit things.  
* The King and many ghosts are all manifest.  
* The French crew is about halved.

# Soul Locations

Three soul locations

1. **Ahm'Drald** \- Defeat the Soul Collector to get millions of human spirits   
2. Emphasize WHY the Corruptor wants technology to thrive \- melting the polar caps will destroy the protective shield, allowing two-way portals.  
3. Emphasize WHY Throckmorton can communicate with the Mariners \- as the few remaining of their species, their meta-spirit is them. There are no others. Meaning Humanity must have an unreachable meta-spirit.  
4. **Zanadu** \- Collect Zayan haunted souls from the ruins of the city [PIC](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1013876930451349504/1179912424703410246/jeesty_A_meteor_crater_in_the_deep_african_jungle._5134e5a1-3061-4b99-9b2e-9bd1c452f8e8.png?ex=657b8213&is=65690d13&hm=a62e04b772cbd03ba5557a9f917f3e746b6b1075a83a73e8bbfd8b6af3ca5145&=), [PIC](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1013876930451349504/1179912963545645127/jeesty_A_smoking_volcanic_crater_with_remnants_of_a_ruined_inca_6c4dcbe5-e75a-4da1-ab36-0b5a9676c811.png?ex=657b8294&is=65690d94&hm=c2bfcc545f22d0cdd9bd288976c0c95a2cc1563e5e27914dc7d3734f79a5ff4d&=&); And there is a tiny Soul Collector hovering above it, collecting Zayan Souls.

### Luna's Major Accelerator

Which is an accelerator to send ship and crew wherever they choose to go, whether Jupiter or the Oort cloud and so forth. 

But what it does is build rockets and a Cloud braking shield onto the ship, along with an integrated power supply. That power supply lasts a trip to Europa and back, recharges in jovian sunlight in about a month. Cloud braking ng consumes about a quarter of its power using the shield.

* **Throckmorton** understands why he can communicate with the mariners \- They are the final representation of the Mariner meta-spirit, like an animal meta-spirit ( implying the existence of an unknowable human meta spirit)  
* Mother Superior Catherine Batteux haunts **Constance**. "You wronged me. I shall not forget." and she inflicts another Black Mark on Constance.  
* Cassius Shaw visits **Constance**. He is entangled with the vengeful and bitter, but powerless, spirit of the assassin Antoine Gris. Cassius warns her against taking life lightly, she is at the edge of a precipice. Cassius does not regret killing Gris, who is a testament to spite.

Something mystic and important happens in the new year.

They arrive in London on Christmas eve day of 1818\.

* Party, then  
* Midnight Mass at the still unconsecrated **All Souls Church** [PIC](https://www.wickedwilliam.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/all-souls-regent-street-1818.jpg). So it is rule breaking and naughty to hold mass there, but it happens. It will be consecrated in 1824  
* Regent's street is underway at this time.  
* The ‘New Street’ upon which it was built was soon re-christened Regent Street in honour of its chief advocate – the Prince Regent, who had a vision for a new aesthetically pleasing London, hoping to rival and exceed Paris. ‘Regent Street’ was the perfect name given that this new road began at the Prince’s home at Carlton House and wend its way to Marylebone Park (which was simultaneously renamed Regent’s Park).  
* As far as the Government were concerned Regent Street was a godsend, providing work during a time of great austerity, unemployment and social disorder – and cost very little thanks to the practice of selling 99-year leases to encourage private investment.  
* Front view of Camelford House, Oxford Street (1850)  
* Lord Grenville inherited the mansion and used it primarily for entertaining until 1816 – when he was made an offer he couldn’t refuse and agreed to lease Camelford House to the most talked-about couple in Regency society: namely Princess Charlotte of Wales and her new husband Leopold of Saxe-Coburg.

**2023-10-26**

- **Quintus** has discovered a mighty power that directs the power of souls  
  - It is a Spirit Thread tesseract in Ahm'Drald. It can redirect the Jovian Hurricanes (which are souls)  
- Fighting the Soul Collector  
- Quintus returns \- he has had another vision, of the storms on   
- They'll have to forgo the forcefield. 1 to fly and three of five in the Ooron chambers you have to decide between force shield vs firing one side's deck guns  
- **Gahan** learning from the guide. Their priorities:  
  - \<\<On their return they will see a mega crab. \>\>  
  - \<\<Gahan is addicted, but will feel VERY unfulfilled because of his Zocto compatibility\>\>  
  - Location of Ooron \- London (I'll know it when I see it), and Tambora battle, Ahm'Drald  
  - Location of weapons \- Anywhere site of an ancient battle  
  - How to fight Soul Collectors \- They didn't know. They suspect it was soul oriented. The battleground of the Soul is where the Corruptor Fights  
  - How can they adapt the ship to be operated by monkeys? \<given detailed schematics.\>  
  - Tactics of the Tisiphone \- 3 skill points  
  - Info on the Wards and Encryption \- learned too latre, but used for the Zayans.  
  - Knowledge of the Spirit Realm \-   
  - How did their Zocto war with the Corruptor go?  
  - Do they know anything about the Mariners?  
  - Knowledge of other sophonts  
  - **London \- Gahan has seen Ooron in London. That was reflected back to him by the guide.**  
  - NOTE: Soul collectors arrived in the meteor that was thrown from Jupiter by the Corruptor.  
  - NOTE: **There will be 4 in destroyed Zocto ships on the surface of Ahm'Drald. And also at Mt Tambora. The Zocto civilization was a brief beacon. The crabs were a problem, but the Soul Collector was their doom. There was a mighty battle at the core of earth,**  
  - NOTE: **Gahan** will do his own learning, like an addict  
  - NOTE: Information about the wards (there is little, but much about the fight on Jupiter Zocto vs Moai and ), and how to encrypt and decrypt (it doesn't know. The Zayans figured that out long after the fall of the Zocto)

At **Syzygy**

- **Tier 8 Builder Crab** is rebuilding the portal.

- But the Architect Crab has six Mariner souls tethered to it, and they can not harm it lest their spirits themselves be lost. Spirit Sight can see spirit thread being woven.  
- **Difficulty 9** to liberate an Orca spirit, which it will attempt to re-capture.   
- \*\* You have to send a voluntarily tethered spirit along with a torpedo for the crab's spirit Thread not to restore it's shape. 

At **Ahm'Drald**

- Must fight the Soul Collector  
- See lava seeping in from the walls  
- Retrieve critical Soul Harbor \- steal all souls from the Soul Collector, and Easter Island, and the old Mariners

- They are at syzygy. The Mariners make short work of the giant crabs and their children  
- They want to use the guide for Gahan  
- The Mariners are escorting them \- puncturing through the crabs shells and eating their minds. Easily dodging the gripping claws of the, relatively slow, crabs.  
- Throckmorton needs to disclose the history of the Mariners to the party

## Mariner Speech

The mariners grabbed the Chains of the Second Ward that had so many humans, and have kept them for use in the Mighty Overthrow.

Their leader is **Huuchin Talibar** (ancient wisdom). His consort is **Huuchin Enkhtai Nedgen**, the ancient gentle one.

* Long we were enthralled by the **Puppet** (the **Purifex's** creation) but you have freed us.  
* We knew, the whole time, what was happening yet our thoughts and voluntary mind were not our own.  
* Our home, the great ship **Ahm'Drald**, created from the metals of our ocean homeworld, resides deep in this planet we created.  
* There we must go, to eradicate the Soul Collector. Then you may gather up all the human souls

## Solutions

1. When they reach Jupiter they can use the Soul Stones to release their Zocto, Mariner and Human souls into the appropriate storms. The power of those storms is co-opted and stored.  
2. That power can then be re-directed  
   - Into Saturn to make a new god (with many Orca swimming amongst the ice rings)  
   - Into the oort cloud to pelt Jupiter's red spot and south pole with asteroids  
   - To directly disrupt the Red Spot,   
3. Any of these will weaken the red spot (corruptor) itself. It will manifest on the surface of Jupiter, and the players must confront it, first physically, and then travel into its Between Lands to utterly destroy its spirit.

## On Jupiter

The players must retrieve a mighty artifact that can channel the power of the Polar Storms.

## About the Mariners

See Monsters and Items

Along the way the players must enter into the **Between Lands of Henton**, and possibly of Bolton as well. Those of Constance are dark and full of peril.

The players each have a Supernal spirit, possibly ancestral, possibly due to the Zayan explosion and those spirits entering them, or maybe something else.

Perhaps they must all die, then join with Henton, and use their combined might to overcome Jovian shielding.

## The Ziggurat

Retrieved by Gahan, stolen from King's Ziggurat on the Second Ward's shoulder. This was the King's Library from which he could find Wisdom and insight into the mind of the Lord Sublime.

(I) TOME OF CLEANSING BY FILTH  
Let the deep ancients be exhumed (oil of the dinosaurs and the ancient plants and seas). Set them ablaze to set the world ablaze. Climate death.  
(II) TOME OF CLEANSING BY LIFE  
Pandemic that wipes out all human life via biotechnology & genetically modified organism pandemic that gets out of control  
(III) TOME OF CLEANSING BY FUTILITY  
Machinery/AI rendering humans purposeless  
(IV) TOME OF CLEANSING BY FIRE  
Outlines mining ooron to give humanity the atom bomb, then creating polarized opponents, only one of which is sufficient to destroy the earth in the Great Winter.  
(V) TOME OF CLEANSING BY DUST  
Tells of the "long work" of finding and then redirecting Daphne, a 12 mile wide former moon of Jupiter. The interior is ice. By splitting the hydrogen from the oxygen, an ad-hoc thruster was created that is moving it into slingshot orbits that will eventually reach earth.  
(VI) TOME OF CLEANSING BY VIGOR  
Overpopulation driving consumption, commons abuse, and ecological collapse. The British Empire is key to this, and the creation of the Eighth Ward of Consumption will eliminate "the keystone animals of land and sea"  
(VII) TOME OF FRACTURE  
Outlines how to fracture mankind with faith, with tribalism, and the necessity of exalting leaders who derive power from division using the Great Tools hate and fear. Exalt his puppets the prophets. It describes the British Empire as a catalyst for this.
