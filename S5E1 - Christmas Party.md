**Daniel Smythe** the Menagerist is there. He tells that Johann Goethe and Brother Lucius have restored his wife Clarissafrom her Gelada form to humanity.

**Quintus** says he has "mastered" reality warping to disguise even large things, but at great cost. Yes, he has a black mark from it.

**Oliver** tells Belzoni infiltrated the Roman cistern (we don't know how) and claims that a green glow has been seen emanating from the eyes of the Medusa stone.

**Maria Fitzherbert** tells that  Bartholemew Skaggs (the Charlie hired by Henton) was found dead by a Purity poison (same as the one that got everyone in Henton's lab). And that George St James, the mad Scott (from the players' recruitment), has died in an asylum from unknown causes. The body was burned.

**Random**  
The topic of the death of Princess Charlotte, and the despair of her husband Prince Leopold of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld, and how he went to Belgium to escape his despair. So sad that she died in childbirth.
