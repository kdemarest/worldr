# Prologue

If the players bring the witches Lady Margaret greets them like sisters. However Goethe and Lucius act coldly. Quintus acts worried and makes the sign against the evil eye.

The players will recognize the pregnant woman from the boat. It is unclear what she is doing here.

They know Maria Fitzherbert, Thomas Young, Brother Lucius, Quintus, Wellington, and Lady Margaret.

They have passing familiarity with Johann Goethe, Lord Castlereagh, Talleyrand.

They are introduced to Goethe, Lord Byron, Klemens, and Ewan Forsythe. But not the woman from the boat (Charlotte) nor Leopold Coburg.

# The Meeting

**Thomas Young** brings the meeting to order.

- We have a lot to get through, so please hold comments and questions until the end. Even if you have urgent information, please hold it until your report. Our guests from the magnificent ship, late additions to the agenda, will report last.  
- After the meeting the Italian Abbott will meet with Captain Bolton to decide a course of action.  
- First, Mr. Goethe will protect this gathering from malign influence.  
  - Goethe smashes a crystal ball filled with sulphur with a small gold hammer. Absolutely nothing apparently happens, unless you can see spirits, in which case a beneficial spirit goes to each person and stands watch.  
- Thank you sir. I will begin the reports.

\<I recommend that the players be ready to take notes and respond to various statements the attendees make\>

NPC Reports

* **Young** reports: Austerity across England, and failing crops all across Europe due to the cloudy skies and ceaseless cold and rain.. The winter is HARD. Unrest in England is rising, with renewed strength in the Jacobites, Spencians and Luddites. Irish Nationalism is on the rise (Moira: "I should think so"), and we have indications that remaining Bonapartists are gaining strength and financial support from an unknown source.  
* **Young:** On the bright side, the Secret Treasury is flush with a massive haul of gold related to the adventures of our guests. Our slavery ban is a complete success and we can reduce the West Africa Patrol. The disruption in North and South America may yield an opportunity to retake and expand those colonies, if only we had the food to support such an effort.  
* **Metternich** reports on the successful re-weaving of monarchy across Europe, and emphasis on suppressing nationalism in the interest of bonding all peoples against the Insidious Doctrine. Nationalism divides\!  
* **Talleyrand** reports: the Bourbons are likely corrupted, but it is hard to tell for certain due to their detached and debauched lifestyles. I predict the continued rise of egalitarian and liberty populist movements within two generations. Old Metternich is sour about it.  
* **Lady Margaret** begins with "Lux lucet in tenebris" (light shines in the darkness, the Waldensian motto). She reports rising activity in the Cult of Purity. Her team continues to investigate the Grimaldi connection. She looks haunted and reports on extreme dissections.  
* **Ewan** reports: the ongoing threat from various Golems. I implore my lords to overlook the common speech renderings, but to report, these golems include Chimney Wights, Cobblekin, Purse Golems and Kettlegrim. Disease, madness, and the theft of babies are on the rise. My team seeks to eliminate the threat, but do not yet know where to strike. BTW he is Obscura  
* **Goethe** reports illusory forces and color. "Threats to individual autonomy are on the rise. The great experiment, supporting Napoleon's visionary attempt to purge Corruption from the continental monarchies, has failed. when he himself became corrupted Metternich's plan was enacted. Now, the forceful restoration of monarchism promulgated by the Congress of Vienna yields domestic stability, but also European leaders with an increasing trend of corruption. While I recognize the value of stability in this post-Napoleonic era, we are back to square one in our struggle where corrupted monarchs can lead entire nations to ruin. We have further discovered that the attitude of our common foe is that we are curiosities to be pulled apart, rearranged, mere mechanisms. These mortal coils mean nothing to it, nor does the dignity of an individual mind, and we can expect no mercy, no humanity from this foe. All the more reason why individual autonomy and the liberty of the common man must be considered and respected."   
* **Coborg** reports: "I return from Belgium with word that it has been purified (Lady Margaret says "please don't use that word"). No longer do the clawed horrors stalk the streets of Brussels. A strange submersible was captured and brought to London. With the problems in Belgium eliminated Charlotte and I may, when Victoria is old enough, have a safe place to retire."   
* **Addington reports**: The depth of the mental and societal manipulations at work by the so-called Lord Sublime are still being unraveled. We know that it tempts with great benefits the ends of which we can not yet see. We know that it dabbles in disease and miasma. It both fears new machinery and encourages it, yet such knowledge has yielded often deadly or damaging results. Investigations of the meteor strike reported in the jungles near Kumasi have yielded little but the extent of the destruction, and the precision of the strike, are difficult to contemplate with current mathematics. In short, even our best intentions may have unforeseen consequences, and analysis must continue. Our efforts are, in essence, an act of faith.  
* **Wellington** reports "Three more submersible crews are successfully trained on the wooden models hidden in the London Bridge pilings. And a third sub bay is now complete. I expect to augment our navy with help from our guests (he nods at the players and Coburg). From a military perspective the failed crops are our number one risk. I recommend a scientific mission to Batavia to investigate the volcano there, and likewise to comprehend whether this is the doing of our shadowy enemy."  
* **Byron** reports: "Alliance forces exterminated nest of skin monsters from the Geneva sewers. A dreadful portal through which stitched together men (andromorphs) once came in Geneva, frightening and inspiring Mary Shelley, has suddenly closed for reasons unknown. Also the Obscura breeding program continues, with births up 12% for the year."  
* **George IV** reports: "Captain Bolton is provisionally raised to the rank of Admiral pending completion of his next mission. Admiral I hope you can forgive the brevity and lack of formality."  
* **George IV** reports: "My father, his majesty the king, continues to deteriorate in his madness. His majesty hardly looks himself. His clothes are constantly soiled because he won't let them be cleaned. He is losing hair by the day. \<there is a catch in the Regent's voice. It is hard to see his father like this\>. On the topic of my public masque Regent's street is under way as proof of my frivolity and ineptitude to govern. Though it has not prevented the threat to my daughter, the perils to this body continue to be eased.  
* **George IV** thanks "Let me take this opportunity to thank our guests for returning my daughter Charlotte safety from Africa. The rumor has successfully spread that she died in childbirth, securing her against further assassination attempts. Princess."  
* **Princess Charlotte** reports "I continue in hiding. The plan is to reveal my newborn daughter, christened Victoria to symbolize victory over the Corruptor, next May as the supposed child of the Duke of Kent. [details](https://www.wickedwilliam.com/tag/prince-regent/) It is as yet unclear whether little Victoria is In Obscura to the Corrupt as my worthy Leopold. God willing it might be so."  
* **Quintus** reports: After our guests' experience with the Ward of Subjugation we have deduced that a Ward of some nature may be present in India, spreading Cholera. Brahman mystics speak of the "Cleansing by Life", which we interpret as an ironic statement about disease. I recommend a mission to investigate."  
* **Quintus**: "Another two brave volunteers have died from misfortune working at the Jovian observatory. Help is needed to study the storms of Jove, but we suspect the vast storms on that world, each larger than our humble Earth, are used to project malevolent power against us. Brother Lucius.  
* **Brother Lucius**, "based on this information, I have ventured in spirit communion to the distant Jovian moon of Europa. I now believe the enormous earth-sized storms on Jupiter are driven by the souls of extinct or enslaved sophonts. Humanity is not the first target of the Enemy, merely the only remaining target. My spiritual consultations reveal that it is at the limits of matter and energy that spirits exist." He gives a ring to Captain Bolton [PIC](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1013876930451349504/1170110801261109269/jeesty_The_spirit_of_Saint_Benedict_in_rich_garb._A_ring_glows__461896e1-957a-4c91-80d2-8331b4d2c69f.png?ex=6557d99a&is=6545649a&hm=990a29487f638766f3005752e742030d4a76009e8b8d44fc27662eed50597821&=&width=506&height=506)  
* **Talibar** in a proper English accent says "If what you say is true, then the souls within those storms may be turned to our purposes. Each spirit, each mind, is shackled in a cruel bondage of delusion. If we can bring word to them, with free souls willingly tethered to advance our cause, we may be able to enable them to free themselves and thereby join our effort. To speak plainly: free spirits can unshackle bound spirits. But It will require the spirits of millions. It is known to me that, at the central nexus of the earth lie dormant such mighty works as may empower this impossible goal. With permission, I will discuss this later with the Italian Abbot Eduardo and Admiral Bolton."

# Epilogue

A meeting with Bolton, the Regent/King, and Talibar

* King George IV attends  
* Talibar points out that the soul collector has been collecting for thousands of years to use Human spirits to power the eighth ward's polar storm. George's death only delays, not eliminates the creation of an eighth ward.  
* The Corruptor has limits. It conditions spirits to believe they have no choice, but only keeps some few shackled un actuality. The truth can set them free.  
* G4 grants three members [PIC](https://photos.google.com/album/AF1QipOTCRxzAnMfLbdoomC6wG7EACkwMejJcUYW5-QD/photo/AF1QipMzEhTAGI-7ajI4G8ZIj29M2s2fovAWY_zwlUr3)@ of the 95th Riflemen to Bolton as his personal guard.  
  * All Tier 4, specialized \+2 with rifles. Armed with Baker rifles, 12 damage. Shots at 300 yards take two rounds to load. 100 yards only one round.  
  * Thomas Plunkett [PIC](https://photos.google.com/album/AF1QipOTCRxzAnMfLbdoomC6wG7EACkwMejJcUYW5-QD/photo/AF1QipNrRDW_8TCEtCiQ7GiU6GRGuKYXFloMWBIEJdEK)@ (famed marksman from the battle at Corunna). He is called simply "the rifleman" and can kill a man at 600 yards.  
  * All are armed with Baker rifles.  
  * William "Bullseye" Hargreaves  
  * Edward "Steady" Thorne (stands for "steady hand")  
* They may decide to fetch Ooron from the Medusa head in the Roman Cistern  
* They may decide to help with many other problems, but should not  
* They may decide to visit Ahm'Drald to retrieve Spirit Chambers, the secreted spirits of the Mariners  
* Thence to Europa for the spirits of millions of plague-killed Zocto, and/or Zayan spirits (where is the bowl from the Zayan temple? Maybe Lucius has been collecting those scattered Zayan spirits for years)  
* Possibly to Venus to find is Venusian spirits were secreted anywhere
