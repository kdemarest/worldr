**Bolton** \- The Akkadian visits Bolton, free to do so because of the disruption to the Second Ward Storm. In a conversation gains the insight that command is kept through belief. No commander can compel but by having the belief, whether through loyalty or fear, of the commanded. And that you must break people down to gain the bond. Command is paper thin. If the people unified they could overthrown ANY commander.

**Throckmorton** \- There is not one Mariner Moon Ship but TWO. The second is hidden in plain sight, the same size as the first, and contains millions of Mariner souls saved from the Corruptor's minions.
