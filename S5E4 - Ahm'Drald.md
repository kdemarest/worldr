# Premise

The power of the Jovian storms is fungible, directible.

Use all these to inject into the 2nd, 5th, and 8th ward storms to tell their kin to rebel.

Spread the word to the deceived souls who are obeying the Corruptor that they are free.

# Ahm'Drald

**On arrival, hear this beat: [link](https://youtu.be/ZagsLrNzg3I?si=jRdW_o2LGNiFcmfm)**

1. Fly to in, and then into it  
   1. The surface, superstructure, public space  
2. Challenges to reach the Soul Chambers  
   1. Hero's Entry  
   2. Temple of Contemplation  
   3. Hall of Ancestors  
3. Seeing the Spirit Loom, and the Minor Accelerator  
   1. Weaving the ship  
   2. Weaving individuals  
4. Scouring the Ship Graveyard  
   1. Find the drummers  
   2. And just as they find Ooron cores...  
5. Fighting the Abomination \- Mariners attack and distract, after hitting it with a Spirit Disruptor "by hand" and deck guns. Then the party must enter  
6. Return to Syzygy & meet Victoria's entourage

### The Surface

[PIC](https://photos.google.com/album/AF1QipOTCRxzAnMfLbdoomC6wG7EACkwMejJcUYW5-QD/photo/AF1QipNcKKSGDtDSLbgeJadGc5Ncl-rlzrRQ3w9C6nO0)@ \- a common area on the surface  
[PIC](https://photos.google.com/album/AF1QipOTCRxzAnMfLbdoomC6wG7EACkwMejJcUYW5-QD/photo/AF1QipPLD_-zB2RFVmxkZSxDat8dWSv6dvKj_455vliM)@ \- the "Earth Gatherers", used by the Mariners in their attempt to hide from the Purifex, to collect asteroids, dust, and debris to form the earth itself around Ahm'Drald

### Weaving Through Crustal Superstructure 

[PIC](https://photos.google.com/album/AF1QipOTCRxzAnMfLbdoomC6wG7EACkwMejJcUYW5-QD/photo/AF1QipNZa3p8TaNx8mB9o1F8ZijDXO3fDkk-nDK2HhLH)  
As they descend they will pass complex metal structures.

### Public Space

[PIC](https://photos.google.com/album/AF1QipOTCRxzAnMfLbdoomC6wG7EACkwMejJcUYW5-QD/photo/AF1QipO6IjPTLFqCBOK3lVHYyCfzsbRNAOAuRSmCvEYf)@  
A common public space, now empty. The water H2O, not mercury as on the surface. It is clear that the place was self-sustaining.

1. ### Hero's Entry

[PIC](https://photos.google.com/album/AF1QipOTCRxzAnMfLbdoomC6wG7EACkwMejJcUYW5-QD/photo/AF1QipOJ6WEKwpJ-R1wSwbxo6coUy2vCEVxd74zEelIr)@  
Location of Soul Chamber \#1 \- hidden with Reality Discipline in the nook  
Written on the floor here is the following: *My people roam the celestial seas, and I am Talibar, master of all I survey. Look upon my works, ye mighty, and despair.*

2. ### Spirit Armor Loom

[PIC](https://photos.google.com/album/AF1QipOTCRxzAnMfLbdoomC6wG7EACkwMejJcUYW5-QD/photo/AF1QipNbOOPW6F3-T0dcjrDtvKD-9hPB8VLZ2yz6W2uF)@   
This device has enough Spirit Thread and energy to wrap the party plus three people. Once wrapped in Spirit Armor you can not remove it except my magical means. Spirit Armor allows survival in harsh environments, including space, for durations the GM may determine. In general it is intended to allow survival on all moons and planets.

A wrapped person looks completely unchanged, unless viewed with Spirit Sight, in which case they look a bit like this: [PIC](https://photos.google.com/album/AF1QipOTCRxzAnMfLbdoomC6wG7EACkwMejJcUYW5-QD/photo/AF1QipOXzqCXpbNjXCmDQm2DEcREVCJACsnjUgHKVLgS)@

3. ### Temple of Contemplation

[PIC](https://photos.google.com/album/AF1QipOTCRxzAnMfLbdoomC6wG7EACkwMejJcUYW5-QD/photo/AF1QipN5U9CkD_mXuo416watiXys03Qw_UNbS0RYXpYb)@  
Location of Soul Chamber \#2  
A character must look into their own self and understand their weaknesses in their relationship with themselves.

4. ### Ship Loom

[PIC](https://photos.google.com/album/AF1QipOTCRxzAnMfLbdoomC6wG7EACkwMejJcUYW5-QD/photo/AF1QipNW-aFUEYWdbY5MsR2peHl5y4e3NOWVIyYxHnvW)@  
And it can do their entire ship, so it can travel through space.  
Once the players' ship is wrapped in spirit thread it can go anywhere through the air or space. The problem is even though they have this ultra powerful thing it is the hearts and minds that need changing and no amount of blowing things up is going to help them (the Vietnam problem)

5. ### Hall of Ancestors

[PIC](https://photos.google.com/album/AF1QipOTCRxzAnMfLbdoomC6wG7EACkwMejJcUYW5-QD/photo/AF1QipPJKaDQG5HBUUTqxHQHS0Q4Mg3FBaJvVM95Y6Jd)@  
*Location of Soul Chamber \#3*  
Talibar has no memory of this place. He "sees only himself" here, a confusing and mystical statement.  
You must

- H/B Use archaeology/anthropology to determine what to do here.  
- A 65 year old man in stasis is revealed. Dc5 to recognize him. [PIC](https://photos.google.com/album/AF1QipOTCRxzAnMfLbdoomC6wG7EACkwMejJcUYW5-QD/photo/AF1QipMlenp2WoS8OXI5nCPqLS0NywRt2aB1Kndw4eJE)@  
- Doctoring to revive him  
- Anthropology to recognize the timing of a dropped handkerchief  
- Francis Bacon, age 65, who discovered a Rosicrucian text leading to giant's causeway. Body in stasis, here he has awaited the future, wandering forever in the between lands of his ancestors. He holds a soul chamber, which is what keeps him in stasis.  
- He has saved the women and babies. He is wandering their between lands healing them in a mighty labor. About 5% are not yet healed.  
- He doesn't recognize tea \- didn't exist in   
- For them to be worthy:

Tracing him inside the spirit chamber, you see him holding a woman, comforting her. Blood and birthing clothes soiled and spilled on the wonder floor.

**The players helped him un-traumatize all the women**

- H Conjure an ancestor (spirit or a representation of a living being), who arrives in a coma  
- See the Black Mark still hovering around them.  
- Then you must forgive them.

\=\> The soul chamber holds the spirits of numerous human women.

6. ### Minor Accelerator

[PIC](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1013876930451349504/1171826088293453874/jeesty_a_massive_gun_for_shooting_spaceships_into_orbit._Within_63031260-cce4-4f8c-995e-e8a940ccb227.png)  
An accelerator, sending them through a Leyden tube to the moon. It connects to the tube, and you sail your ship into one end.

You end up "caught" by the decellerator at the other end.

7. ### Breedery

The Birth Tender \- [PIC](https://photos.google.com/album/AF1QipOTCRxzAnMfLbdoomC6wG7EACkwMejJcUYW5-QD/photo/AF1QipOpgAp46ANUhBprFWG2_oW7-ZsbnshuNNy4pGQT)@

Deep deep in the heart of this place Soul Reapers used to breed humans in synthetic wombs so that they can harvest the souls to send back to the 8th ward polar Storm on Jupiter. Or rather they would, but infant souls are fragile, and hard to harvest and keep, so there is a massive facility for it, bloody wombs, but abandoned.

The players will stone medical tables with the bones of people strapped to them, and smaller bones scattered on the floor. Dark dried blood stains the floor. A doctor can discern that all the adult bones are those of women, and the small of babies.

Bacon will tell that he entered found a spear, entered here, and destroyed the Tender, nearly being killed in the process.

### Item: Spirit Chamber

[PIC](https://photos.google.com/album/AF1QipOTCRxzAnMfLbdoomC6wG7EACkwMejJcUYW5-QD/photo/AF1QipMpKHYZixkgbA_m7Ehen2StyLPxXQDPGL7-6INO)@  
A fourteen sided figure the tetradecahedron  
Shaped like dodecahedron similar to the Soul Sphere, each can carry all the human, Zocto, and Mariner souls, to use in redirecting the Jovian Storms. It is small, like a black hole. The weave of the Spirit Thread is like steel.

They players just retreated away from the Soul Collector. They got the Ooron from the first ship. 3x  
They are finding weapons, but unbeknownst to them the mercury vapors have corroded them   
All.

### 7.5 Surface Cave with Mariner Ship

[PIC](https://photos.google.com/album/AF1QipOTCRxzAnMfLbdoomC6wG7EACkwMejJcUYW5-QD/photo/AF1QipMofsauF54D2LHGKSpDG3w7HiHN-WnT35x2UYzU)@  
The exit to the surface is through a cave. Lying just outside is a crashed ship, corroded from the quicksilver sea. It is a Mariner crashed ship. Inside, if searched, is a Spirit Chamber.

### 8\. Ship Graveyard

[PIC](https://photos.google.com/album/AF1QipOTCRxzAnMfLbdoomC6wG7EACkwMejJcUYW5-QD/photo/AF1QipMFqBrWldEXY9UbULaalzw5FOyP6oFk46A0Kk4x)@  
Haunted by the spirits of the Zocto ship captains, all of whom were overwhelmed by possession and turned against each other.

Octopoid robots drum a war tune at regular intervals. [**Link**](https://youtu.be/ZagsLrNzg3I?si=jRdW_o2LGNiFcmfm), [audio](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZagsLrNzg3I&t=60s), [PIC](https://photos.google.com/album/AF1QipOTCRxzAnMfLbdoomC6wG7EACkwMejJcUYW5-QD/photo/AF1QipNOqVKRSrfO0TCDvqnZMpBI60A0zMzl5ZSGJTSd)@

- There is a single Ooron [PIC](https://photos.google.com/album/AF1QipOTCRxzAnMfLbdoomC6wG7EACkwMejJcUYW5-QD/photo/AF1QipPcmELg4f8Y6dghqRDVnKpjewgeIwKULv21wyxS)@ in a device that is broadcasting power to all the robots  
- Armory has about ten Ooron projectors  
- No torpedoes \- all were stored up front where the engine room was, and when Ooron modules cracked it irradiated and destroyed them.  
- The mercury vapors have decayed most everything.

**Each time drums stop the Soul Collector arrives faster, curious why the sound stopped.**

Haunting spirits of the Zocto dead require DC 9 to free them from reliving their turning upon themselves and destroying everything.

Zocto Captain [PIC](https://photos.google.com/album/AF1QipOTCRxzAnMfLbdoomC6wG7EACkwMejJcUYW5-QD/photo/AF1QipP6xvrxWyZTvUk286DdM1ALyHXHMAB7XfHfwSbZ)@  
Captain's log \- describes how a madness took them all.

Wrecks:

- Europan Aegis \- have ooron five modules  
- Zocto Triumphant \- has three more ooron modules

As many torpedoes of whatever types as you like.

# Spirit Collector Confrontation

1. It has already disabled the force shield.  
2. It will spray their golden helmets  
3. It will plunge them into Nightmares (see below)  
4. It rises high to the ceiling  
5. Inside it are squirming, interwoven human bodies, which it jas grown as a reflection of the souls it carries, too all attached, grabbing anyone inside or on the surface  
6. It grabs the mast and falls, overturning the ship and stabbing into the gravity generator   
7. Everything starts floating \- Mariners help players, witches use brooms  
8. Ghost crew will take over, or guard the live crew.  
9. What role for witches? Taking on the black marks of the others  
10. Some sort of damage that takes the number of black marks you have and squares it and then applies the damage against you. That requires the witches to really take those black marks on  
11.   
12. Grab Bolton, rip him physically.  
13. Then it will rip souls (Henton spirits can guard. He rolls dc 9\)  
14. Inflict betrayal effect (Henton's spirits can guard)  
15. Transform somebody into a Flesh Tender  
16. See Lavinia, Ekua, who make an opening to send in players.  
17. King George to the rescue, embodying (Bolton?) infusing them all with the power of the British Empire. His spirit has part of the Ward Power within it,and can draw some power from the Jovian polar storm.  
18. Boffins must repair the grav gen

### Spirit Collector

[PIC](https://photos.google.com/album/AF1QipOTCRxzAnMfLbdoomC6wG7EACkwMejJcUYW5-QD/photo/AF1QipO9NQNqPzXtda5DXIc-oZDzP7Oc10q_qScIqurd)@  
The Spirit Collector conjures up ghosts of the player's pasts. It pulls horrors from its collected spirits, an unstoppable weapon against any sophont.  
Tier 9  
Health: 500 (enormous)

- Note: Descending below the mercury will shield you perceptually from the Spirit Collector.  
- **Disintegration** \- rays lance out from it, stopped only by Spirit Thread, and living beings; associated clothing an gear is typically not harmed, due to the mystic nature of spirit thread and the "domain" of spirits.  
- **Aqua Regia** \- sprays this mix of hydrochloric and nitric acid to:  
  - dissolve gold (helmets or armor for example)  
- **Deflect** \- uses telekinesis (via captured spirits) to deflect incoming missiles or bullets. Less effective if one is too close.  
- **Rip spirit** \- recruits captured spirits to pull spirit out of a living being, dc 9 vs a power representative of "who you are in your heart". A ripped soul ZZ its own body for a day and a night, then enters the Spirit Collector.  
- **Penetrating Grasp \-** tentacles weave through the victim, sucking out 6 points per round of whichever pool is highest  
- **Old wounds** \- it can inject captured spirits to conjure old black shard wounds. Henton's eye, Throckmortons leg, Constance's shoulder, Bolton, Gahan?  
- **Betrayal** \- via captured spirits you feel your friends will betray you, and you oppose them accordingly.  
- **Dupe** \- Player gets a note to play along. Their character seems to fail a role and transform into something that sucks brains from the mouths of others.  
- **Transform** \- DC 7-\>6 vs Body Autonomy transforms you into a Flesh Tender [PIC](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1013876930451349504/1182531203522375721/jeesty_The_skeleton_of_a_horrible_monster_tick_like._Long_spide_2988be16-c2a4-4f35-9eb2-315fdef009dd.png?ex=658e4381&is=657bce81&hm=0ee17e028f76d7a7c8839fa3a5f7f2312561de2ea599e6f3e852be1133279e4e&=&format=webp&quality=lossless&width=506&height=506)  
- **Bolton \-** taken in his soul, smashed, ripped apart. Freed when the creature is destroyed.  
- **Constance** \- transformed into the same type of Tender that guarded the pregnant women. They discover that the Corruptor makes no souls. All creatures are borrowed. Transformed humans.  
- **Many crew melted into wax \- Will reform after the battle.**

- Spacial sense  
- Maintain Body Form \- gives \+1 Body Autonomy  
- Reduces incoming damage by 3

The players may shoot limbs off it, bore through it riding Talibar or other Mariners, climb its limbs from the deck to destroy eyes, and more. Deep inside it the can reach its Brain, and the Explorer and others may rip it out by the root. It is essentially immune to gunfire of any kind.

The Brain [PIC](https://photos.google.com/album/AF1QipOTCRxzAnMfLbdoomC6wG7EACkwMejJcUYW5-QD/photo/AF1QipPK5Stexnw5v9DmSmgDdvPg2dKhY2wR2wgd5BYf)@

- The Explorer arrive  
- Brain Damage \- 14

Human, Zocto, Mariner, Zayan \[Ioan, Venusian\]

Unlike past trials, the players are now **bound by fate**, and can communicate, and even move from one person's trial to another.

The players pass through a howling void of shackled spirits. Wailing, moaning, ash in the hair.

The key for the players is **not too resist the haunting** in some way but to instead convinced the spirits that what they have been told isn't true that everything they heard from the soul collector to poison their minds is simply lies. **The key is changing the perspectives of the spirits, or accepting that they have a different perspective.**

**It is essentially trying to take over their minds, which is what losing to your haunting means happens.**

**Each encounter inflicts a Black Mark for the duration of the encounter upon each player character.**

- Gold helmets  
- 1 asset from Bolton (related to planning)  
- Crew gets an asset from Bolton  
- Coins under tongue

\==NEXT TIME==  
All still have Black Marks until they kill the thing  
\--\> All spirits encountered in the Soul Collector's attack are now visible ghosts on deck.  
The soul collectors has lost its cool and directly attacked the deck of the ship, smashing crew and grabbing whom it can

- Constance \- carving out soul orifices with the magic spear from Sir Bacon  
- Throckmorton \- riding Talibar shooting lasers from his fins; blind  
- Henton \- in spirit form carving through spirit thread; blind in the mortal realm  
- Bolton \- on deck wielding ooron projector, recently freed from its grasp. Soul is loosened from his body  
- Gahan \- piloting the ship to get above the Spirit Collector and force it into the Quicksilver. No effects. Obscura.  
- Crew all have guardian spirits from Bolton and Ross's prior dead crew

See above for the Soul Collector's actions.

## Nightmares

**Constance**		Mother Superior Catherine Batteux [PIC](https://photos.google.com/album/AF1QipOTCRxzAnMfLbdoomC6wG7EACkwMejJcUYW5-QD/photo/AF1QipNGcNkTBs3zWMnTopzSnwS3LZccorwVzE9CxM1n)@. "You wronged me. I shall not forget." and she inflicts another **Black Mark** on Constance. Cassius Shaw [PIC](https://photos.google.com/album/AF1QipOTCRxzAnMfLbdoomC6wG7EACkwMejJcUYW5-QD/photo/AF1QipMOrtfpS66lk_JTGfcHhY82mxS9J5M2lW3bd1d8)@ visits Constance. He is entangled with the vengeful and bitter, but powerless, spirit of the assassin Antoine Gris [PIC](https://photos.google.com/album/AF1QipOTCRxzAnMfLbdoomC6wG7EACkwMejJcUYW5-QD/photo/AF1QipM74ECFm7p4fP9_ZXU3TAqtPpLbhSx7sSgHs0Wz)@. Cassius warns her against taking life lightly, she is at the edge of a precipice. Cassius does not regret killing Gris, who is a testament to spite.

- The prisons are of our own making, of guilt or blame or hatred.

**Bolton**			The dead of his crew [PIC](https://photos.google.com/album/AF1QipOTCRxzAnMfLbdoomC6wG7EACkwMejJcUYW5-QD/photo/AF1QipNNUU1Oxg3wS6dHApjCZIa-pwLcGcetxzQzKLGa)@, who say he lead them to their deaths bodies invaded by the living roots of the fifth Ward, and the crew of Ross who recount the horrible torture of being transformed into half animal abominations. He can't help but notice the beautiful men he has met, wasted by death. Coop Figgleston [PIC](https://photos.google.com/album/AF1QipOTCRxzAnMfLbdoomC6wG7EACkwMejJcUYW5-QD/photo/AF1QipPbdZv5BC1_T-ueE3MCX_lzqtygBeFnb3qvJ8f5)@

**Throckmorton**	Cyril Montjoy [PIC](https://photos.google.com/album/AF1QipOTCRxzAnMfLbdoomC6wG7EACkwMejJcUYW5-QD/photo/AF1QipMCfrJnJ47H4DmWhxteLPvygJubXkGOsZ8F251L)@ \- his bully, and his Catholic great Aunt [PIC](https://photos.google.com/album/AF1QipOTCRxzAnMfLbdoomC6wG7EACkwMejJcUYW5-QD/photo/AF1QipPB0yfea6HGLTYj9EOooOBOPwDRTV45HduqEcWM)@, who admonishes him for fraternizing with apostate heretics.

**Henton**		Not the Zayans \- they are in a different Soul Collector. His mother Adelaide [PIC](https://photos.google.com/album/AF1QipOTCRxzAnMfLbdoomC6wG7EACkwMejJcUYW5-QD/photo/AF1QipMiUa4hsSotCuDtJW_M2wgtsqNaeC8gUePTyDMt)@, who blames him for the death of his brother Phineas [PIC](https://photos.google.com/album/AF1QipOTCRxzAnMfLbdoomC6wG7EACkwMejJcUYW5-QD/photo/AF1QipNABr1U03MsvuXYoHZdKkpK3t0REMihTUFmYXI3)@ (the first time Henton saw spirits). Phineas lies there, his head crushed by a carriage wheel, and thousands of London's dead stand behind him, in judgment.

**Gahan**			Gahan is Obscura, so it can't see him. Leopold, who is also Obscura, will also be available to work with Gahan as needed.

Each player characters must face challenges from their youth or their lives, but not alone. Gradually they discover that they can communicate, counsel each the other, and face their traumas as a group, one confrontation at a time.

The human souls being collected by the Soul Collector for the eighth Ward will be the catalyst injected into the eighth polar storm to control it. And all the rescued Mariner (from the moon) and Zocto (from Jove) for overcoming and controlling the power of the Zocto and Mariner based polar storms

# Syzygy Again

The Belgian submarine, with Wellington commanding, delivers Leopold, Charlotte and Victoria to the team.
