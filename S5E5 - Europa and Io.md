**2024-02-01**

REWIND A FEW DAYS... OR MAKE IT LAST LONGER

Meeting in Henton's Between Lands, guarded by Goethe and Faust with attendant spirits. Discussing Meriwa and Constance protecting Bolton from engaging with the Pedestal.

* It's true, he now feels drawn to confront the Corruptor (who will overwhelm him).  
* Gahan may as well, depending on Dudley's choice.  
* The night is Dramatic  
  * [Creepers](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ml4MhMjmapNTFYD-ifeZb_XncwotmAcRF9zSmtC7zb0/edit#bookmark=id.nmtnp5o305h9) are on the ship after the Inquisitor's visit.  
  * [Meduseloids](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ml4MhMjmapNTFYD-ifeZb_XncwotmAcRF9zSmtC7zb0/edit#bookmark=id.gerbwucwvexo) from the Lunar Purifex ship are aboard.  
* Boffins are studying the pedestal, and how to Cloud Brake  
* Were the boffins told not to look at Jupiter? One may come to Gahan for example seeking to know where they're going, and what they're do there.  
* **Constance** must save Victoria from a creeper. See Day 4\.  
* **Gahan** feels his Zocto nature emerging at Europa. He senses the way to the Zocto Spirit Oculus. He is also the disease vector from Zocto to humanity ..

### Boffin reports: {#boffin-reports:}

- Mariner architecture  
- The spirit chambers aren't Mariner. They're stolen Purifex artifacts  
- The minor accelerator violated Newton's laws

# The Voyage {#the-voyage}

The Celestial Navigator pedestal built by the Major Accelerator has a hand print. Touch it to see in your mind. 

The globular Meduseloids from Luna will start to eat away at the ship, and consume sailors and boffins.

### Day 0 {#day-0}

The Celestial Navigator Pedestal is discovered, along with the self powered rocket engines and hull shield.

### Day 1 {#day-1}

Earth is gone. Speed is 1.5M knots.  
Charlotte and Leopold, with Victoria, tour the ship.

Victoria sees Henton's tethered spirits, "monkey" she says, pointing to the air.

That night Constance has a vision. [PIC](https://photos.google.com/album/AF1QipOTCRxzAnMfLbdoomC6wG7EACkwMejJcUYW5-QD/photo/AF1QipMqhcVdwCeuH8nK6sm1p4nC7j2uighhQpoiK5zY)@

Speaker: Herschel The Wonders of the Celestial Sphere

Jacob Grimm visits each night to tell her a fairytale.

### Day 2 {#day-2}

Charlotte asks Henton if Vic can see her grandfather. If H can make George manifest (this is within his power) they play pat-a-cake together. Peekaboo fails due to George's transparent hands. He teaches her about all the farm animals, making suitable noises, at which she giggles.

Night Two: Thomas Carlyle (Historian), "The Epic Tales of Human History"

Grimm tells another fairy tale

*Late Night*

That night the meduseloids strike. One sailor is discovered with an M up to his neck. So the sight is strange: just a head with a red rubbery blob below the neck. Eyes open. Unable to speak.

* Ten more with attachments: Roll 50/50 sailor or boffin.  
* Attachment Point 1d4: Lhand, Rhand, Lleg, Rleg  
* Amount Consumed 1d6: 1 is only hand/foot. 6 is up to the neck.

3 boffins dead, 2 sailors dead, 3 boffins loss, 2 sailors \- left leg to the body, left leg to the knee

### Day 3 {#day-3}

Vic and George play blocks together. He reads to her, and teaches her how to read, which she masters.

Night Three: J. M. W. Turner (Artist and Illustrator)  
Topic: "Art and the Sublime in Nature"

Vic reverses roles and she reads to Jacob tonight.

Henton in his dreams takes a year pilgrimage with each Sophont species, being fed, hearing oration of the great leaders. Moira visits periodically.

### Day 4 {#day-4}

Bolton's Inquisitor.

Vic is gripped by a Creeper. It flees into her Between Lands. The lands are vast, an entire planet of beauty where the British empire extends, darkness elsewhere. There Vic is a pure and regal queen. [PIC](https://photos.google.com/photo/AF1QipMIewzVaSlEH5Rx214P9Mv5P3Qw3uyiajZR6l6w)@

The Creeper [PIC](https://photos.google.com/album/AF1QipOTCRxzAnMfLbdoomC6wG7EACkwMejJcUYW5-QD/photo/AF1QipNCvcO5SiHP96VN09zHJn0QnmnuP4141DiGMQap)@

Constance must fight the Creeper, while fearfully Vic observes. After she says she got a Mark, and asks to learn how to fight in the Shadowlands as she calls them.

### Day 5 {#day-5}

~~George convenes court in Vic's Between. He declared that Victor spoke a prophecy to him. Will be needed:~~

* A Spirit Guide to summon all  
* A General to lead the spirits  
* A Healer  
* A Dark Mentor  
* A Secret Weapon

An ansible message comes in. "Napoleon has launched his offensive starting in Portugal. Intelligence says a fleet is heading this way."

**Vision of Moira leaning over the crib. [PIC](https://photos.google.com/album/AF1QipOTCRxzAnMfLbdoomC6wG7EACkwMejJcUYW5-QD/photo/AF1QipO9Ixrs1EdRInqLtwPa1ep_NYZyZOVZ4slljpbz)**@

DONE G3 tells Henton that he is leaving him.

Henton sees a new kind of link.

Vic asks Constance to be her mentor, how to defend herself.

Speaker: Corvisart on The Human Body: A Marvel of Nature (but he is dead)

**Arrive in the evening at Jupiter, and must Cloud Brake**

## Manifest Spirits {#manifest-spirits}

With all the spirit chambers around the spirits on the boat get more and more solid. Bolton realizes they can be commanded.

Ghost crew don't feel pain, and can ignore gravity, hold their hands in fire.

The echoes, the memories, link the spirits with those that influenced their lives.

- They can manipulate anything on the ship due to the spirit thread wrapping, which is really a permeation  
- And the density of spirits is bringing something that makes the corporeal

# Cloud Braking {#cloud-braking}

Approaching Jove Seeing the Great Red Spot from space: [PIC](https://photos.google.com/album/AF1QipOTCRxzAnMfLbdoomC6wG7EACkwMejJcUYW5-QD/photo/AF1QipN_pK7zkqsSPtscWNOsA3qF_aI-Md-QURBSZlHu)@

You'll see:

**Storm Bands** \- [PIC](https://photos.google.com/album/AF1QipOTCRxzAnMfLbdoomC6wG7EACkwMejJcUYW5-QD/photo/AF1QipMqwZ1OpPLEG2Kd0cCOgKTxkA_ImCPqh9XxAJj3)@ raging latitudinal storms of great power. Between these bands are "valleys" of cloudless depth, within which one can see things like the Jovian Ring Cities and the Swallowed Planets.

**Cloud Spirits** \- [PIC](https://photos.google.com/album/AF1QipOTCRxzAnMfLbdoomC6wG7EACkwMejJcUYW5-QD/photo/AF1QipNFr-YAlXosiLmw6rmrFHcrnuJ7utQH_hiUwzeH)@ the clouds have a few, drifting sophont souls in them, but more, they have the meta spirits of animal species from many planets. Mysterious.

**Swallowed Planets** \- [PIC](https://photos.google.com/album/AF1QipOTCRxzAnMfLbdoomC6wG7EACkwMejJcUYW5-QD/photo/AF1QipOGc-nNyr5FwbBXvVBPfpLhNsH3UzAuAQSoIBv1)@ You'll also see the Entrapped Planets beneath the clouds.

# Europa {#europa}

You'll end up in an orbit around Europa, and see all the parts described below.

### Zocto Spirit Oculus {#zocto-spirit-oculus}

Any party member part Zocto, or with such affinity, will **sense** a focal point of Zocto spirits deep under the ice. [PIC](https://photos.google.com/album/AF1QipOTCRxzAnMfLbdoomC6wG7EACkwMejJcUYW5-QD/photo/AF1QipP9rE8X2Ad2XnrxG2r38WeDmRVyidXPw7HZdY-m)@ of the icey surface.

## Trapped Ionians {#trapped-ionians}

A civilization of Ionians has been stranded here by the Corruptor. Requiring a sulphur dioxide atmosphere and heat to survive, every day is a desperate struggle. Seeking to avoid death by freezing they mine the core for thermal relief.

Where the Ionians have set down core mining facilities to sap all heat.

**Ionian**  
[PIC](https://photos.app.goo.gl/ztQ8oZ9nQEKfUxpf9)@  
The Ionians are the organisms that are in snail shells. The average Ionian lives in that shell all their life.

Irella the Ionian is Obscura

* She uses overly emotional descriptors in her speech  
* Convincing the souls dc 7 to get attention, and dc 7 to restore their fascist monarchist hierarchy  
* The first three generations, landed by lies from the corruptor, died in hundreds of thousands. Their nobles had pride, noblesse oblige, and almost Japanese code of conduct.  
* All that was lost as the leadership accepted the robotic suits, the warm warm robotic suits, from the corruptor. And the Golem crystals in the suits brainwashed them all.  
* All except the occasional Obscura like Irella.  
* The old leaders things the new ones are traitors and deserve to be Shelled and Salted.

**2024-02-15**

They're above the ice. Just gathered all the Ionian spirits

* Check the granted Powers and follow up with Gahan, Constance. Let Victoria grant a boon to Bolton.  
* Headed towards Jupiter.

### Thermal Mining Habitat {#thermal-mining-habitat}

* [PIC](https://photos.google.com/album/AF1QipOTCRxzAnMfLbdoomC6wG7EACkwMejJcUYW5-QD/photo/AF1QipP2f7z1ShIlVUq303jgr0BImsvvBaPhy6eSXnLd)@ \- area colonized by Ionians

Leads to the Jovian Ring Cities. The Ionians used this to colonize Europa under the Corruptor's direction. Left off, generally, but the PCs could activate it with a stealth mission.

### Ice Wastes {#ice-wastes}

[PIC](https://photos.google.com/album/AF1QipOTCRxzAnMfLbdoomC6wG7EACkwMejJcUYW5-QD/photo/AF1QipOCX8D9d7segnnvL9xvBRR2rIsrvC2nz4KdX80M)@ \- landed on the surface, daytime

## Badlands {#badlands}

Craggy, barren and rare. Just crustal rock from long ago.

## Penetrating The Ice {#penetrating-the-ice}

Option A: Melt your way down, through the ice, using the new rockets at the back of the ship. The accumulated meltwater causes blinding steam, but you essentially become like hot nickel sinking through ice.

Option B: Use Ooron projectors. The ice is in layers 100' deep, separated by water. Cutting has perils of gushing water. Ship can then lift out each ice plug. Also dangerous. Find a recent crater to gain some initial ground.

Option C: Infiltrate the Ionian mining platform and follow the thermal extractor downward.

## Below the Ice {#below-the-ice}

Once below the ice one might find.

### Ionian Thermal Mine {#ionian-thermal-mine}

[PIC](https://photos.google.com/album/AF1QipOTCRxzAnMfLbdoomC6wG7EACkwMejJcUYW5-QD/photo/AF1QipN5fjXnHVBrjAf_M-ssbhHgDLPV4qKFkaKE3M1S)@ \- the deep mine near the moon core

Many dead, fretting from the unjust nature of their stranding and deaths, sleepily haunt the ocean floor.

The location of the mine has moved perhaps three miles over the 50,000 years that the Ionians have been stranded here, as the rapidly shifting surface plates of Europa's core have drifted. With Spirit Sight one can see it, tracing back the eras.

At eh moment of first landing there are perhaps 300,000 souls, killed by the futile efforts of the Ionians to begin the mine. There are few nobles, and many commoners. Then, over time, more somnolent spirits spatter the long-cooled landscape, along with mining structures long disused, until one reaches the current mine itself.

### Ice Outposts {#ice-outposts}

[PIC](https://photos.google.com/album/AF1QipOTCRxzAnMfLbdoomC6wG7EACkwMejJcUYW5-QD/photo/AF1QipNIqbfDzO6O5DHsM8Sc3cLsZgLiGIymw4NEl86x)@  
Set in the upper waters below the ice (which is uneven, including giant stubby "icicles" thousands of feet in diameter. Such icicles have been carved out into Zocto Outposts, frigid, at the far edges of their civilization.

### Deep Cities {#deep-cities}

200 miles below the ice, mostly intact 50,000 year old cities exist of grown coral. They are covered with medusoids, like the lunar Purifex craft.

### Domesticated Crabs {#domesticated-crabs}

The traditional home world cattle of the Zocto, easy tempered herbivorous grazers that plod beautifully among the majestic buildings. Enormous spider crab like creatures, nearly identical to those found at Syzygy. Up to 150' tall they were like cattle to the Zocto, and survived the plague.

### Crab History {#crab-history}

The Zocto brought their crab cattle when they escaped the plague to Jupiter, and again tens of thousands of years later when they fled war on Jupiter for earth.

A constructor crab was secreted among them by malign forces. It constructed the Jovian Gate near Syzygy in secret for years.

When the carnivorous, genetically engineered crabs came through they did it out of sight. The Zocto merely thought that their domesticated crabs were multiplying fruitfully. Their ranks swelled, and then they attached all at once.

**2024-02-08**

We ended here.

* Throckmorton took his time curing the disease.   
* Everyone is asleep near Ocularium  
* Crabs walk by  
* Gahan is leaving the Spirit Chamber  on deck  
* Small numbers of spirits available at other settlements  
* The disease will mutate and recur in 3 days

# The Z-Plague {#the-z-plague}

A carefully designed organism that targets sentient creatures. It spreads through contact with liquids or skin, reproduces in water. It is invisible and abundant in the European ocean.

The plague starts with the Explorer, then Gahan in whom it adapts, and spreads to the entire ship. DC 12\. In any case everyone gets it. **Give fair warning to everyone that points will be at a premium fighting these symptoms. Everyone roll 3d6 and keep those 1-6 digits. Then defend against them.**

1. Symptom: Necrosis \- blacked parts of the body, especially the face, with accompanying loss of function  
2. Parasitic Infestation: Diseases like dracunculiasis (Guinea worm disease) involve parasites living and growing inside the body, eventually emerging through painful blisters in the skin.  
3. Hemorrhagic Fever: Diseases like Ebola cause severe, uncontrollable bleeding both internally and externally, often from multiple orifices (like eyes and ears), along with high fever and severe pain.  
4. Neurological Decline: Diseases like Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (a prion disease) can cause rapid mental deterioration (roll DC 5 to make any choice), and memory loss (roll DC 5 to remember anything)  
5. Gangrene: This is the decay and death of tissue resulting from a lack of blood supply, often accompanied by bacterial infection. It can lead to amputation of the affected areas.  
6. Delusions

The Boffins will all help deal with the symptoms.

# Moon of Io {#moon-of-io}

If the players go there they'll find that the robotic Ionians are all very much alive and fully enslaved.

The surface is molten, the most volcanically  
 active body in the solar system. A gravitational tug-of-war between Jupiter and Europa periodically deforms the moon in what are called The Rumbles by Ionians. Every time it passes Io there are quakes and new volcanoes erupt.

Io used to be a moon of Saturn. It was always hot, but after the Corruptor stole it life became cataclysmic for the Ionians.

# Evening Lectures {#evening-lectures}

1. Night One: John Herschel (Astronomer)  
   * Topic: "The Wonders of the Celestial Sphere" \- An engaging discourse on the mysteries of the universe, constellations, and recent astronomical discoveries. Herschel could captivate the audience with insights into the stars and planets they are voyaging past, blending scientific facts with the allure of the cosmos.  
2. Night Two: Thomas Carlyle (Historian)  
   * Topic: "The Epic Tales of Human History" \- Carlyle could regale the audience with dramatic and philosophical interpretations of historical events, possibly focusing on great explorations and discoveries, drawing parallels with their current journey.  
3. Night Three: J. M. W. Turner (Artist and Illustrator)  
   * Topic: "Art and the Sublime in Nature" \- Turner, with his profound connection to landscape and the sublime, could discuss the intersection of art and the natural world, perhaps even creating a live sketch or painting session demonstrating his approach to capturing the beauty of their surroundings.  
4. Night Four: Jacob Grimm (Linguist)  
   * Topic: "The Power of Language and Myth" \- Grimm could delve into the fascinating world of linguistics, folk tales, and myths. An evening filled with enchanting stories from different cultures, exploring the richness of language and storytelling.  
5. Night Five: Jean-Nicolas Corvisart (Personal Physician)  
   * Topic: "The Human Body: A Marvel of Nature" \- On the final night, Corvisart could speak about the wonders of human anatomy and medicine. His talk could include fascinating case studies from his career, insights into the healthcare of notable historical figures, and discussions on the advancements in medical science..

### Celestial Navigator Pedestal {#celestial-navigator-pedestal}

The Major Accelerator created two pedestals with a human hand imprint. When you place your hand upon it you can visualize celestial navigation and ask basic navigational questions. It let's you:

#### View Celestial Bodies {#view-celestial-bodies}

View any planet or large rock in real time at 50m per pixel. Looking at the side facing the ship you see in real time.looking at the backs is simulation but seems real to the viewer.

* Venus is obscured by clouds.  
* Looking at Jove and seeing the GRS prompts Inquisitor Invasion.

#### View Orbits {#view-orbits}

See all the bodies moving in relation to each other. One can wind the planets backwards and forwards, but the body is always shown with current surface features. Going back can show the Zanadoo Meteor, but without surface features.
