# Jupiter {#jupiter}

Remember that Jupiter contains numerous swallowed planetoids and asteroids, former homes of the two "unknown" sentient species in the list below.

Important: The Corruptor **does have limits** to its power. It shackled all the spirits in each storm, but since it can't directly control so many it convinced them all, with threats and consequences when they were first shackled, to obey and relies on their beliefs and despair to keep them in check.[^1]

# Prelude Events {#prelude-events}

## 1\. Sensing the Corruptor on Jove {#1.-sensing-the-corruptor-on-jove}

Both Throckmorton and Henton sense the Corruptor. Henton because it is sentient and Throckmorton because it is its own meta spirit. A one-of-a-kind sentient species

**Henton:** The corruptor Converses with Henton. It says that it knows what he will attempt, and that it will destroy him. It says that it will take the spirit of the witch first above All Else. And rip it apart. It offers Henton Venus.

**Bolton:** The corruptor has a conversation with Bolton. It offers Bolton complete power over all the Earth, mastery of the British empire, as well as all the savages through which it's cult of purity has grown.

\*\* The corruptor is reaching directly into their minds. They're simply hallucinating, but it may SEEM as though others are being puppeteered.

**The nature of the Mariners is that they seem calm, like a placid sea, but they are a tempest of anger against the Corruptor that destroyed their civilization. Like a tumultuous sea.**

## 2\. Divining The Nature of the Wards {#2.-divining-the-nature-of-the-wards}

Quintus, Goethe, the Witches and Lucius all show up.

* Henton and Throckmorton: What is the nature of the Wards?

**Goethe Reports**

* The great red spot is a storm imbued with the spirits of an alien species. Millions upon millions, all slain by one of their own number. (whose mind was intentionally corrupted by the Purifex)  
* They have discovered that the subjugation of the spirits in the storms is literally an exactly what creates the words. It is the projection of that spiritual power that incarnates the words on each planet.  
* To disrupt the storm is to disrupt the ward, and have the opportunity to create your own

## 3\. Quintus' Crisis {#3.-quintus'-crisis}

* Quintus arguing with Moira \- what have you done? He won't want to talk about it, stating that his own thoughts are his alone. She freely admits that she granted Victoria the ability to call on Moira's life energy thrice for protection.  
* **Quintus is having a crisis because**, although he saw Victoria's spiritual importance, he never expected her to become super intelligent like she has. He is alarmed and at his wit's end.

## 4\. Granted Powers {#4.-granted-powers}

* DONE Bolton: 3x uses of George wanting \+3 on any task relating to leadership  
* DONE Henton: 3x uses of Moira granting \+ 3 on any task related to spirits  
* DONE Gahan: 3x uses of the Explorer's training on any task relating to stealth  
* DONE Throckmorton: 3x uses of Corvisart 's training on any task relating to healing, including applying healing to the spirit realm  
* DONE Constance: 3x uses granting a \+3 to others due to her training them

## 5\. Throckmorton Symbiote {#5.-throckmorton-symbiote}

Throckmorton is offered to merge with one of the Mariners, who has taken the name "Alice"

* He will come to realize that there are currently only six instead of seven Mariners.  
* Me may deduce that one of them has merged with Victoria

Once he merges: [PIC](https://photos.google.com/album/AF1QipOTCRxzAnMfLbdoomC6wG7EACkwMejJcUYW5-QD/photo/AF1QipPOxQkx1--INyqAvZ6bw5eJDBjaRV31TRLXjNAO)@

* He will lose many powers  
* He will forget, if he knew it, that the Mariners put themselves in the devolved position, and he will strongly deny that such a thing is possible if he ever hears about it.  
* He will instantly gain cybernetic healing (+3) and physical immortality  
* He can make periodic rolls to both recover some of his powers that are lost during the merge and to gain some of the new advantages of his woven bio cybernetic form.  
* None of this changes his spiritual mindset.  
* At the players discretion, he can make a HIGH roll that allows him to reveal to the Mariners that it was they themselves who chose devolution, accidentally cursing themselves to 3 million years of madness. They may not accept this. DC 8\.

## 6\. Victoria's Changes {#6.-victoria's-changes}

The changes in Victoria are due to the activities of the Mariners.

* The Mariners are not the specific organic creatures that everyone sees.  
* They are instead the cybernetics themselves, composed of both meccano electrical and biological aspects.  
* They have reproduced one of themselves into Victoria, a symbiotic sophont interweaving. That has heightened her intelligence, and her ability to see an objective reality. They chose her because she is both Obscura and has very strong intrinsic Spirit Mastery potential.  
* When all is said and done she will be given a choice about whether to retain this symbiotic relationship.  
* She is likely to choose to give her mother the experience of raising a normal child, and to take her place at the head of the British Empire.

## 7\. Learning By Example {#7.-learning-by-example}

Victoria roughs up one of the French sailors, accusing him of being disloyal. She says "you must tell me what you know." and has him beaten to the floor. He protests that he did nothing. If Constance asks, Victoria says "Is this not how we protect ourselves?"

## 8\. Shattered Defenses {#8.-shattered-defenses}

As you arrive the word comes by Ansible. Meteors have struck the polar ice caps, generating massive tidal waves on the northern coasts. But the subtext is that the Polar Glyphs have been substantially disrupted. If the players want to gate in the British Forces, they may do so. Those will become pseudo-spirits as well and ... well, we'll see.

# Jovian Regions {#jovian-regions}

## Mega Structures {#mega-structures}

The manifest spirits of the dead, of many species, inhabit the various mega-structures, serving the paranoid, angry, jealous Corruptor. The manifestations are not the true "spirit" of each, rather, those are trapped in the Ward Storms far to the north.

One can see that each Jovian polar storm has a gravity membrane around it, and souls within, howling. They are visible as translucent auras, rushing in a huge cyclone. One feels the intimate nature of their connection to glimpses of time (eras of specific cultures) within the grand sweep of the universe.

Each Jovian Storm [PIC](https://photos.google.com/album/AF1QipOTCRxzAnMfLbdoomC6wG7EACkwMejJcUYW5-QD/photo/AF1QipO2etZZmeqy7boAg-FTyL2cZ6N9TqbxNUZjBjFz) is powered by an extincted species' souls. Most from millions of years ago originally places there by the Purifex to initialize the Corruptor.

\#8 is Human		(consumption)		Britain			George III

\*\* This unknown is from a species the Purifex had already bred as slaves, and whose souls they used   
\*\*\*  The unknowns are from species from captured planets now engulfed by Jupiter itself.

The power of \#**1 Unknown** is focused on the Cult of Purity, keeping it secret yet well recruited.

The power of **\#4 Ionian** is focused on Tambora and continuing the eruption.

The power of **\#6 Venusian** is focused on Napoleon directly. There is no 6th ward present on earth.

# Converting the Storms {#converting-the-storms}

There is a tower at the center of every storm, and upon each is a Mansion within which the Ward of that Storm resides.

To reach it one must 

## Entering Each Ward Storm {#entering-each-ward-storm}

All the players feel the power of the Ward Storms, and what they can do.

* Roll a d8 once each and consult the Aetherion Powers for a preview. Henton may roll twice.

The Jovian Mist is the quasi-spiritual essence that swirls, cloud like in violent storms, around Jupter, its captured planets, the megastructures, the Ward Storms, and the GRS.

Entering Jupiter's clouds is a Spiritual matter. There is little meaning to sending your physical body there. There is a blurring. Everyone will both remain aboard ship, AND use their spirit thread armor to travel Jupiter. Both will be awake and conscious.

For example Victoria enters battle, she will still exist as a babe in the arms of her mother, as well as the ethereal being. Wounds taken by the Aetherion will show up on the baby, and Throckmorton can heal them in real time.

**When team becomes semi corporeal, they can see the crew as if they were all real, and the real world (living crew) looks insubstantial. Anything wrapped in Spirit Thread looks the same in both.**

**They can move in 3d, but their "grip" on space in tenuous.**

**The spirit chamber is just as real in both "worlds"**

Entering:

* Roll DC 10 int vs Chaos Resistance to enter the Jovian Mist.  
* \+Effort May spend Effort of any flavor  
* \+1 for each fate point spent.  
* \+2 if Henton uses his power of entering Between Lands (3 int \+2 int for each \+1)

Henton, Bolton, Throck \- normal rolls  
Constance \- will realize that she may not enter unless Baby Victoria also enters.  
Gahan \- may enter freely, no roll

## Uniting the Spirits: Bolton {#uniting-the-spirits:-bolton}

Bolton must unite the spirits in the Spirit Chamber, of the aligned species, in purpose to spread the word to resist the Corruptor.

**DC 15** to unite and form a compelling message. For Humanity you must *also* navigate the Human Thought Leaders. See the section below.

\+3 for same species (eg Human)  
\+1 for looking similar  
\+1 for traveling a long time with a member of that species  
\+1 for bringing a member of that species with you to advise  
\+1 for Henton's empathy for that species, if they've have the souls for \>1 month  
\+1 for party member with significant insight into the species  
\+n for leadership assets and skills  
\+n for cultural insight \- see below  
MAYBE \+3 from Victoria

Insight  
In general, any strong observations about the sophont culture will do, but specifically it could be:  
\+1 for Humans if you make them free to choose  
\+1 for Zayans if you appeal to their redemption for enslavement of their automatons  
\+1 for Zocto if you help them see the power of working together  
\+1 for Mariners if you appeal to the idea of revenge  
\+1 for Ionians if you show strong-man leadership and boldly order them to unite

NOTE: The non-human sophonts have just as many thought leaders and religious leaders as humanity does, and Bolton must speak with and convince them all. But for the Zocto this will be simplified and integrated into his roll.

Feelings that will be encountered

- Fear of the Corruptor  
- Apathy that this is the final fate and there is nothing else  
- Uncertainty of unknown unknowns

## Unleashing The Spirits

Henton is the Conduit through which millions of spirits may be united into new wards, or a single ward. He has a vision of Aetherion, a unity of many sophonts, but it is unclear. He can introduce the spirits into the appropriate maelstrom in any order.

3x rolls (beginning, middle and end) across twelve turns  
DC 12 to introduce the spirits into the storm \+1 \+2 \+3 \+4 \+5 \+6

* \+1 if he can call a member of that species a friend  
* \+1 for each species due to Empathy with them if he's had their spirits at lease a month  
* \+3 for Humanity, from King George, if Bolton allows it.  
* \+2 base \+1 per storm from Victoria being present and helping  
* X \+1 if an aligned PC (Gahan=Zocto, Throck=Mariner) helps at a cost of 4 int and a fate point

**Throckmorton** \- with Mariner capabilities can emit a cutting light from his finger tips.

# The Ward Storms

A mansion sits atop each Maelstrom Tower, with a dodecahedron on a pedestal.  
Note: All wards are full of Black Marks, so any ability vs them is maximized.

## Ward Storm 8: Consumption (Human)

\#8 is Human		(consumption)		Britain			George III

**Ward**: King George III  
**Mansion**: [PIC](https://photos.google.com/album/AF1QipOTCRxzAnMfLbdoomC6wG7EACkwMejJcUYW5-QD/photo/AF1QipPpABu5EipBrgBI-LIo3f80PMPic6sI77Fs_SE-)  
**Environment:** 

**Challenges**

- Warn: None, as long as King George III has been rescued  
- Skin Monsters Tier 5  
- Venusians Tier 4  
- Moai Tier 8

## Ward Storm 5: Subjugation (Zocto)

\#5 is Zocto		(subjugation)		Bantu			Ghana Soninke [PIC](https://photos.google.com/album/AF1QipOTCRxzAnMfLbdoomC6wG7EACkwMejJcUYW5-QD/photo/AF1QipOtGaF67ziOSne4s8SFA8NH5qiiX30Ub9BbULyI)@

We need each ward to subject the players to one of:  
Reality Discipline	(illusions and manufactured beliefs)  
Chaos Resistance	(bad luck)  
Liberated Mind	(possession and influence)  
Intention Shield	(anticipating actions, and mind reading)  
Body Autonomy	(control over senses and feelings)

**Henton**: Fortuitous Malfunction (of a trap), Serendipitous Landmark (when lost), Weak Strain (vs poison), Decipher, Read the Signs (of the past), Negate Danger

**Constance**: 

**Gahan**: Contortionist, Controlled fall, Evanesce, Free to Move (past obstacles), 

**Bolton**: Strategize, 

**Ward:** **Black Opal King**\* \- you realize he resembles the creature you fought beneath Kumasi   
**Mansion**: Jungle ziggurat [PIC](https://photos.google.com/album/AF1QipOTCRxzAnMfLbdoomC6wG7EACkwMejJcUYW5-QD/photo/AF1QipNTJObQ8Edo6i4Mobm3cxQZE0r1g2fP1ZR-K29G). Pitch blackness requiring eye drops or light sources.  
**Environment:** Water droplet mists. **Gravity** once you enter the mansion.

**Challenges**

- Make clear there are only FIVE mariners...  
- Within the **Ink Children** can be seen only with DC 7 perception, in which case you'll see the dust gathered at their feet, and can roughly track their movement.  
- **Ink Children** [PIC](https://photos.google.com/album/AF1QipOTCRxzAnMfLbdoomC6wG7EACkwMejJcUYW5-QD/photo/AF1QipNmPv3EHNONT0lhuVpwm5xY5kFYlXlVFPFiXK_0) Tier 5 (7 is not spotted)- wearing masks [PIC](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/8f/1c/6a/8f1c6a51fd9f4de68f1faa7fdf7c848b.jpg)@ \- **Constance** and **Bolton**. The ink children will attempt to grip people (removing their invisibility), shrinking and embedding themselves within the flesh of their victim to become Ink Dwellers.  
- **Ink Dwellers** \- These are Ink Children embedded in the flesh of a person, about fist sized. The question becomes how do you remove them without injuring the host. Fire works well, but noxious ointments, such as those the witches might provide, can work.  
- **The Ward** uses his power DC12 vs Liberated Mind to force the Spirit Master to "Obey". Then, it taps directly into the Corruptor for DC 15 vs Liberated Mind to "Obey". Then Lucius steps in.  
  - **Lucius** channels the power of the Human storm to subjugate the Black Opal King. It is pretty harsh, and gruesome.  
  - **Lucius** teaches this to **Victoria**, then dies from his efforts.  
- **Goliath Crabs** [PIC](https://photos.google.com/album/AF1QipOTCRxzAnMfLbdoomC6wG7EACkwMejJcUYW5-QD/photo/AF1QipPEkTfeCYX73CmPBCnDk_HeCIgLXFT8gSX6MYgE) Tier 7 \- They stand in the jungle around the mansion. Once the players enter the crabs will climb the building, then stab their spiny legs into and through the mansion walls, trying to pierce those within with perhaps a bit more drama than effectiveness. 8 damage for being impaled.  
  - Strategy:  A leg can be grabbed by a sufficiently strong player, or the **Explorer**. **Throckmorton** can influence these crabs.

## Back at the Ship

A Spirit Collector rises out of the storm. 

* **Victoria** suppresses their ability to swerve the incoming missiles and torpedoes.  
* It becomes clear WHY she is what she is: She is the descendant of Geo3, a potential Ward Avatar, and much of the power he possessed passed to her upon his death.  
* When one is left first one, then two more, and then a hoard of them rise above the clouds. Time to run \- they will pursue, but too slow to keep pave.

## Ward Storm 2: Shaping (Mariner)

\#2 is Mariner		(shaping)		Minoan		Sandobar [PIC](https://photos.google.com/album/AF1QipOTCRxzAnMfLbdoomC6wG7EACkwMejJcUYW5-QD/photo/AF1QipNqoaGXqAltIvWz_LQ40j6Y8-cfP8q1NUQ47AJC)@  
**Rationale:** Chosen because the mariners are in fact arbitrarily shaped, and can re-shape those they inhabit.  
**Ward**: Sandobar [PIC](https://photos.google.com/album/AF1QipOTCRxzAnMfLbdoomC6wG7EACkwMejJcUYW5-QD/photo/AF1QipNqoaGXqAltIvWz_LQ40j6Y8-cfP8q1NUQ47AJC) the seafaring Minoan  
**Mansion**: White Bone Ziggurat [PIC](https://photos.google.com/album/AF1QipOTCRxzAnMfLbdoomC6wG7EACkwMejJcUYW5-QD/photo/AF1QipPTZ4_z16Tm_hJWeGbvhZyUz31cK7gTXzW0zo6I)  
**Environment**: Lightning storms with pelting rain

**Challenges**

- **Betrayal**: The ward Sandobar tells them they have been betrayed \- a Mariner resides within Victoria.  
  - Confronting the mariners can be catastrophic and likely result in deaths.  
  - Persuading them might work, confronting them with the idea that THEY doomed themselves to 3 million years of insanity.  
  - **Henton** has a cypher than might fit  
- **Interwoven** \- filaments of web-like nanofibers weave through out the interior here. One must climb through it all at 1/4 speed, unless you have a special movement ability. Flying throughout the open spaces of the web are Shark Birds. You can see the web moving, as if being touched, but cannot see what is touching it.  
- **Vesperna** [PIC](https://photos.google.com/album/AF1QipOTCRxzAnMfLbdoomC6wG7EACkwMejJcUYW5-QD/photo/AF1QipP-Rm4fvjHhAtMb1Zyio8ZFv3lPVivFgC-dR1g2) \- gravel at everyone's feet. They clutch and grab and beg.  
- **Toravians** [PIC](https://photos.google.com/album/AF1QipOTCRxzAnMfLbdoomC6wG7EACkwMejJcUYW5-QD/photo/AF1QipMe8EtJLZuGQI5PoRkiNmGukjzboopJBbrkubfb) \- shackled to the walls. The stink requires DC 6 vs Body Autonomy or be disabled each round. It effects the nose, the eyes, and breathing. Coin under tongue negates.  
- **Shark Birds Tier 4** [PIC](https://photos.google.com/album/AF1QipOTCRxzAnMfLbdoomC6wG7EACkwMejJcUYW5-QD/photo/AF1QipOLeLhKUiiLYBamgQlOXGfWUmgPjsx5tNOP8t08) \- remember that you can't see them without Reality Discipline, and by that time they're landed on everyone. They can be Abjured, and Abated back to Sandobar.

**2024-03-28 They just defeated the 2nd Ward.**  
The party has heard from Sandobar about Victoria being inhabited by a Mariner. The ward characterized this as a betrayal and her as an abomination. The party may need to discuss

* **Lucius** is now tethered to **Victoria**, and won't speak against Mariners  
* **Moira's** opinion is that the Mariners have change Victoria's mind, but not her essential spirit. She generally advocates for everyone knowing truth, so she will struggle against her link to reveal that there is, in fact, a Mariner within Victoria.  
* **Moira** can be tapped to discover whether the Mariner (**Talibar's** wife) in Victoria has a black mark. The answer is yes. One.  
* **Constance** \- let player know that Constance she feels a compulsion not to speak against the Mariner takeover of Victoria, due to influence along the heavy tether.  
* Reminder: It was **Throckmorton**, when he first connected to the Mariners, who discovered their self deception about the 3 million Years of madness.

## Onboard Ship

**Lucius** is now tethered to Victoria, and won't speak against Mariners

**Quintus** reports that he is now tethered to the spirit of **Wellington**, who has been slain, and with whom he left a certain charm such that Wellington's spirit would not depart the world.

## Ward Storm 4: Tribalism (Ionian)

\#4 is Ionian		(tribalism)		Olmec			K'inich Janaab	 [PIC](https://photos.google.com/album/AF1QipOTCRxzAnMfLbdoomC6wG7EACkwMejJcUYW5-QD/photo/AF1QipOvXvEVFOAEgyybOSKasI63PJc2QIvh1v7qUiH7)@  
**Rationale**: The Ionians were isolationist, strict in their autocratic hierarchies, refusing to work together to save any other tribe from falling into the surging volcanic morass of Io.

**Environment**: Approaching is far more turbulent \- must roll to navigate it (Bolton). Flakes of burning ash suffuse the air, making breathing difficult and burning the skin

- Ward will lay in with any heavy object it can, 10 might per strike  
- Much harder to turn because Henton and Bolton didn't have a lot of time to empathize and understand their culture and mindset.

**2024-04-04**  
They defeated the 4th Ward. Left the Mariner in Victoria.  
The Convocation of Sophonts, where Princess Charlotte's moral concerns are addressed, is next.

**2024-04-18**  
They disrupted the 7th ward storm, and returned to the ship

* Bolton rolled a 1 and instead threw the Zayans into tumult by mentioning that they were a client species.  
* They disrupted and freed the 7th ward, who is now a Zayan Spiritmaster who wants to talk to the Zocto progenitors. They do NOT have the power of the Zayan storm, but neither does the Corruptor.  
* Moira helped Henton and gave him a \+3. She helped Gahan by spitting.  
* Many players need a lot of healing  
* The philosophy of the witches is that hearing the truth is difficult, so everything they do magic-wise is a little disturbing, like spitting in gahan's eye with a chewed herb.  
* Victoria is now \+2+4=6

Now:

* They basically can confront the corruptor or go after the other wards. If they go after wards they should know that they'll basically have to allocate one of their storms (a Victoria \+1) against each to keep it disrupted.  
* And in any case, the red spot would just come to them if they tried, and bring the campaign to a conclusion.

## On Success

If they are united, you can choose what you wish to do with them: Combine into Aetherion, or free them forever. Without as much power as possible in Aetherion there is little chance of overcoming the Corruptor.

## Option A: Releasing Victoria

The players may decide that Victoria must be freed of the Mariner **Enkhtai Nedgen** \- [PIC](https://photos.google.com/album/AF1QipOTCRxzAnMfLbdoomC6wG7EACkwMejJcUYW5-QD/photo/AF1QipOfjFfoYvJzEEn1U_J2dKOhXkaDUH55o7uXevLS)

Victoria will retain about half of her maturity, roughly age 8\. She will be excitable and unregulated.

## Option B: Embracing the Mariners

If the players choose they can some, or all, gain Mariner symbiotes. Their lives will extend, they'll gain:

* 3 armor  
* Never knocked out until all pool is gone  
* 10 might  
* Vengeful Mind \- inability to believe their 3 million years of madness were their own fault  
* Vengeful Doom \- no choice in the final confrontation with Corruptor. Killing it is the only way

## Sophont Convocation

After all Ward Storms are turned Princess Charlotte, mother to Victoria and grand daughter to George III will call a Convocation of the Sophonts to discuss what to do.

The Corruptor is the meta spirit of an entire species. To kill it is to extinct a sophont race, and the discussion revolves around the ethics of the task ahead.

Defeating the Corruptor is imperative, but its weapons should not be discarded lightly.

**George III** [PIC](https://photos.google.com/album/AF1QipOTCRxzAnMfLbdoomC6wG7EACkwMejJcUYW5-QD/photo/AF1QipNewZq6oqXc6vRrs0olrPxsl911h8KYYTyyBYDa) \- the British Empire must expand to become a Parliament of Worlds, united and ready to resist the return of the Purifex. Void crossing ships are the new Navy. Planets mere islands ready for administration by the Crown.

**Charlotte**:  
"May Providence guide us, may courage sustain us, and may history remember us as the architects of a new dawn for all sentient beings."

## Summoning Aetherion {#summoning-aetherion}

Once you bond the spirits together they create Aetherion, a good themed titan based on the purity of baby Victoria: a spiritual metaphor for their united power.

Baby Victoria in the Jovian spirit realm consults the players. Should she:

* Take the aspect of Vengeance (as the Mariners desire)  
* Take the aspect of Order (as the Ionians prefer)  
* Take the aspect of Justice (as her great grandfather suggests)  
* Take the aspect of Stealth (as the Zocto prefer)  
* Take the aspect of Knowledge (as the Zayan's prefer)  
* Takes the aspect of Mercy, as her purity demands.

**SCALE:** Perhaps each movement takes about ten minutes to perform. Otherwise the movements involved might reach the speed of light.

## PC Activities {#pc-activities}

Maybe when Aetherion is attacked mentally, all of the players get to roll or not as they choose. They can spend whatever they like, strategize it as much as they want. But they can't roll sequentially.

Likewise they can surface their capabilities into Aetherion. Constance is co-existent with Victoria. Each other players can choose one power of theirs to contribute, and when that power is rolled then that player does the rolling. Also for that turn, their spirit is at risk of attack... we'll see.

When Victoria confronts the corruptor every player character has a role. They bring **all their own powers** and each get a turn using Aetherion's body. Except Gahan.

* **Bolton** **strength rolls** \- must lead multiple sophont species in a massive spiritual charge.  
  * Resists anything that demoralizes the united spirits  
  * Lends his strength to Aetherion  
* **Henton** \- **spirit rolls** must guide the spirit storms to follow Victoria, and unite to empower her.  
  * Resists spirit   
* **Throckmorton** brings the **Mariner** spirits; heals Aetherion.  
* **Gahan** must climb   
  * He needs to sneak up to and climb onto the corruptor with some kind of devastating weapon.  
* **Constance** merges with Victoria, making most of her rolls.

* **Gahan** must scale the Corruptor, hiding from deranged sophonts, to deliver the bomb  
  * Difficult terrain  
  * Numerous Zocto, Ionian, Zayan, and other horrifying sophonts

### Capabilities {#capabilities}

Aetherion can do any of the following **Henton feels all this**

1. Move astral bodies  
   1. Generally move small astral bodies, like meteors. The closer they are (like the captured moons and planets) the easier it is. Doesn't mean it is easy.  
   2. Push Europa into the GRS. The water cools the spot, slowing it spin and power. The Ionians will be lost.  
   3. Crashing Io into the GRS. Fewer than 50,000 Ionians remain living there. But not zero. The heat it generates equalizes the heat from Jupiter's core that drives the red spot, leading to less convection.  
   4. Hurl captured astral bodies (within Jupiter) across the solar system, or within Jupiter  
2. Pick a polar storm, likely the vengeful Mariner storm, to move into the GRS disrupting it. No black mark.  
3. Activate the captured spirit powered Purifex Megastructures via the manifest spirits running it to:  
   1. Produce a new Ward Storm  
   2. Breed a new sophont species  
   3. Travel to engulf any planet  
   4. Create magnetic anomalies on remote planets to produce volcanic activity  
   5. You can open wormhole gates locally and to other planets, unless glyph defenses are in place.  
4. You can influence minds, at a great distance, as long as there is an affinity to your own good or evil.

**Sensing** \- It is the only member of its sophont species, meaning that both sentient spirit masters and animal spirit masters can feel it.

**AnimalSpirits** \- The tumult within the clouds is partly due to animal spirits.

**OnDefeat** \- Upon defeat baby Victoria will ask what should be done.

* Executing the Corruptor is viable, prompting the gradual self-destruction of Jupiter and the Ward Storms.  
* Forgiving the Corruptor dissolves it, reconstituting the lost planets and reviving a member of each lost sophont species. The players need not do this. It is a test of Constance's growth.

**Merged Reality** \- The great red spot is the between lands of the Corruptor, and entering it in the real world is the same as entering it spiritually.

**Blood** \- Entering the Spot one realizes that that it is composed of the swirling blood of all the dead sophont races destroyed by the Corruptor. Anything without Spirit Armor is immediately destroyed and their soul consumed.

Round 4  
Dmg: 30+8+38

Bolton \- 13m

- Move storm vs dc 15  
- Retain control vs dc 7

**2024-04-25**  
Corruptor is at DC 11 now  
Victoria grants bonuses 2+4 storms  
Planetoid blocked one black tether  
1 Ionian storm is allocated into the GRS  
1 Mariner storm is allocated into the GRS  
Zocto storm is coming in 3 rounds

* Corruptor is drawing spirits along the two remaining black tethers to gain \+3 DC and double damage.  
* **Henton** will be able to hurl the planetoid (moon) at one black tether per round  
* **Henton** or **Gahan** should notice \- how did the Corruptor hit Victoria, if she is Obscura, but only the PCs have attacked it?  
* **Victoria** as Mariner is mind controlled. She starts to dissolve the link among herself and the PCs.  
* Note: When Corruptor reaches DC 10 then Constance can technically "murder" it.  
* **Gahan** will experience sleet, and fog, and have to cling on as the creature moves. One of Constance's strikes hits near him. is about a round away from reaching the nape of the neck, where he can set off the bomb. Explorer is with him, helping him not get eaten by the creatures making up the skin of the Corruptor and the sophonts haunting its surface.  
* **NOTE:** Victoria had her neck snapped because the Mariner is symbiote to her, and IT can be seen. Corruptor suddenly realizes this and directs ALL attacks at Victoria, ignoring Constance, Henton and Bolton.

## Corruptor {#corruptor}

Tier 15 \+3 when battling normals  
Health 40,000

### Powers {#powers}

**Tragedy** \- For the spirit sensitive, its tragedy is overwhelming. You see how the entire, sentient sophont species of the corruptor was created, lived, and never user for ANYTHING except to create the corruptor. Roll DC 8 or lose a turn to emotion.

**Enslave** \- DC 10 vs Liberated Mind or become utterly enslaved by the Corruptor

**Crack Open Mind** \- DC 15 vs Intention Shield or suffer 2 hindrances on all rolls for 3 turns

**Your Body is Mine** \- DC 15 vs Body Autonomy or your one muscles will spasm so hard you break your own bones, or become blind or deaf, or unable to speak. (1d4)

**Claw** \- vs Spd defense. 28 damage

**Intimidate** \- DC 15 vs Reality Discipline or see something so frightening that your purpose and allegiance waver. This is typically used on huge crowds, and PCs must role Leadership to avert it.

A corrupted individual could suggest using the power of the storms to push the Earth out farther on its orbit so that ruins can be etched into the bottom of the expanded ice. But in fact there won't be enough power to both push it out and then stop it and Humanity will be extinguished

Make sure it's a debate about philosophy not for example celestial mechanics. Does the Earth turn inward by defending itself only, or do we bomb the hell out of the corruptor, or do we bond in unison as a collective to oppose the corruptor.

Ultimately it has to be a confrontation where the characters and who they specifically are makes whatever the idea is work.

# Carlyle Speech

Ladies, Gentlemen, and Esteemed Beings of the Congress,

Today, we stand at a precipice, facing an adversary that seeks not just to dominate but to obliterate the very essence of our civilizations. The Corruptor, a being of unfathomable malice, has woven its dark threads through the fabric of our worlds, exploiting our weaknesses and turning our strengths against us. Yet, in the shadow of such dire adversity, we are presented with an unparalleled opportunity for unity, growth, and the rekindling of our shared spirit.

Throughout the annals of history, it has been the indomitable will of the few that has turned the tides against the seemingly insurmountable. Heroes, in the truest sense, are not born from tranquility but forged in the crucible of necessity. Now, more than ever, we require such heroes—beings of unwavering courage and moral fortitude—to step forward. It is not merely a call to arms but a call to elevate our collective essence, to confront not only the Corruptor but the shadows within ourselves that it seeks to manipulate.

We must delve into the annals of our histories, not as distant observers but as avid learners, gleaning lessons from our past missteps and triumphs. The Corruptor's strength lies in its cunning, in its ability to divide and conquer, to turn brother against brother, even species against species. Yet, herein lies its greatest weakness—for in choosing to unite, to embrace our shared destiny, we wield a power far greater than any mystic force. Our unity, our shared resolve, and our dedication to the principles of integrity and righteousness shall be our shield and our spear

In this spirit, I call upon each of you, from the humblest to the most exalted, to rise above the pettiness that has hitherto divided us. Let us forge a legacy of unity and heroism, a beacon for all generations to come. For in unity, there is strength; in strength, victory; and in victory, a new beginning.

Carlyle Overview 

Thomas Carlyle, a Scottish historian and philosopher of the 19th century, was known for his belief in the importance of heroic leadership and the impact of the individual on history. Here are some historical lessons and perspectives Carlyle might offer in your ttrpg scenario

1. The Great Man Theory: Carlyle is famous for his "Great Man Theory," suggesting that history is shaped by the actions of "heroes" or extraordinary individuals. In facing the Corruptor, Carlyle might advise seeking out or becoming heroic individuals with the strength of character, wisdom, and leadership to unite humanity and other species against this threat.  
2. Moral Force: Carlyle believed in the power of moral force and integrity. He might suggest that combating the Corruptor requires not just physical or mystical power but a strong moral foundation. The species of the Sol system would need to confront and overcome their weaknesses, which the Corruptor exploits, by adhering to principles of integrity, unity, and righteousness.  
3. The Importance of History: Given Carlyle’s emphasis on the study of history to understand the present and influence the future, he would likely recommend a thorough examination of the histories of the seven sophont species that were nearly driven to extinction. Understanding how the Corruptor manipulated their weaknesses could provide crucial insights into preventing humanity’s downfall.  
4. Spiritual and Cultural Renewal: Carlyle often lamented the mechanization and loss of spiritual vitality in his own society. He might argue that facing an existential threat like the Corruptor requires a cultural and spiritual renewal among the threatened species, rediscovering the values and strengths that once made them resilient.  
5. Struggle and Sacrifice: Carlyle's views also encompassed the necessity of struggle and the inevitability of suffering in achieving greatness. He might frame the battle against the Corruptor as a pivotal moment in the evolution of the species of the Sol system, requiring sacrifices but also offering the opportunity for unprecedented unity and growth.  
6. Individual Responsibility: Finally, Carlyle would emphasize the role of individual responsibility in the face of collective challenges. Every member of the species threatened by the Corruptor would need to confront their personal weaknesses and contribute their unique strengths to the collective effort.

In essence, Carlyle might view the struggle against the Corruptor not just as a battle for survival, but as a profound opportunity for moral, spiritual, and cultural growth, led by individuals of exceptional character and vision

5. Henton: Move astral bodies  
   1. Generally move small astral bodies, like meteors. The closer they are (like the captured moons and planets within Jupiter) the easier it is.  
   2. Push Europa or Io, including into the GRS. There may be attendant sophont deaths.  
6. Bolton: Pick a polar storm, likely the vengeful Mariner storm, to move into the GRS disrupting it.   
7. Henton: Activate the captured spirit powered Purifex Megastructures via the manifest spirits running it to:  
   1. Produce a new Ward Storm  
   2. Breed a new sophont species  
   3. Move Jupiter through space to engulf any planet  
   4. Create magnetic anomalies on remote planets to produce volcanic activity  
   5. Open wormhole gates locally and to other planets, unless glyph defenses are in place.  
8. Henton: Influence spirits/minds, even at a great distance, as long as there is an affinity to your own good or evil.
