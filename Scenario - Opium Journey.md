# Setting

Europe bled silver as tea and silk from Qing China were imported, and the Chinese imported nothing at all. China accepted only silver for taxation.

Meanwhile, in india:
1757 - the EIC wiosn the Battle of Plassey in bengal, gaining the right to tax it
1773 - the EIC formally monopolizes opium cultivation and refining in Bengal
1175 - 75T of opium is "sent" to China
1817 - 450T of opium is "sent" to China

In Mexico, silver mines in Zacatecas and Guanajuato dug 80% of the world's new silver. And this meant trouble:
1808 - Napoleon deposes the king of Spain, weakening colonial rule
1810 - Zacatecas and Guanajuato successfully revolt, and silver production halts
1817 - Britain, made poor by the Napoleonic wars, needs money

Optium exports to China grew from 75T in 1775 to 450T in 1817, and was positioned to explode in the 1830s to 2500T. This rapid growth

So this is the moment we're in:
* Ruthless men are seeing their finances skyrocket
* Opium trade is growing 6% per year, prompting more and more greed
* Bengalis are forced into growing what the EIC dictates, and then taxed at the same time
* The players are far "above" the indigenous in power, yet, tightly constrained by EIC governance


# 1. The Fields — Poppy-Growing Villages in Bihar & Bengal (Patna / Ghazipur Region)
**Atmosphere:** Hot, humid plains. Silt-heavy rivers. Villages rebuilt repeatedly after floods. Fields under surveillance by Company agents.  
**Languages:** Bhojpuri, Maithili, Bengali; English from overseers; Persian still lingering in administration.
**Economic Setting**: 

Cotton textiles: India was still a major exporter of finished cotton cloth at the beginning of the 19th century. 
Countercurrents

Raw cotton: Increasingly exported as raw material for British cotton mills. 
Countercurrents

Opium: A rapidly growing export, particularly to China via the British East India Company. Bengal/Bihar opium was central to this trade. 
Economics Discussion

Indigo dye: Significant export item; Bengal was a leading producer for European textile industries. 
Economics Discussion

Rice: Both for local consumption and regional trade; sometimes exported within South Asia.

Spices and other agri-goods: Pepper, sugar, linseed, mustard seed, tobacco, and animal products (hides, ghee) were traded locally and regionally, though not as dominant as the big four above.

# Summary of the Narrative Arc
- **Start:** Flood-prone poppy fields in North India.  
- **Middle:** Industrialized colonial processing → auctions → illicit maritime trade → offshore Cantonese gray market → smuggling into the delta.  
- **End:** Opium embedded in Chinese urban life, feeding corruption and silver drainage.  
- **Characters:** Multinational chain — Bhojpuri farmers, Company officers, Parsi and Armenian merchants, Malay sailors, Cantonese brokers, Hokkien smugglers, inland Chinese merchants and physicians.  
- **Tone:** Exhausting heat, bureaucratic coercion, private greed, and the quiet dread of people who know the system is rotten but continue because it's profitable or compulsory.

# 12. The Structural Reason for All This Diversity
The 1817 Indo–China opium system was built out of:
1. Mughal administrative residue (Persianate clerks).  
2. British fiscal extraction (Indian labor + British officials).  
3. Diaspora merchant houses (Armenians, Parsees, Luso-Indians).  
4. South China maritime cultures (Cantonese/Hokkien smugglers).  
5. Macau’s ambiguous legal status (Macanese intermediaries).  
6. Global silver flows (Mexican silver driving the entire cycle).

This combination created a single, multinational, semi-legal machine moving opium from Bihar to the Chinese interior.
