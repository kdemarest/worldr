Crew  
Master Navigator Thomas "Charts" Beckett

* "Chart" due to his encyclopedic knowledge of sea charts and constant habit of updating and correcting them.  
* An avid collector and creator of ship-in-a-bottle models. In his downtime, Beckett can be found intricately carving miniature masts or threading the tiniest rigging through the neck of a bottle, a stark contrast to his large, calloused hands that steer the ship's course.

Ship's Boy Pip Dawkins (Billy)

* Pip often composes poems, and the crew listen with appreciation. Pip expresses the homesickness combined with adventure that sailors find on the sea.  
* Possesses an uncanny knack for being in the right place at the right time to overhear gossip and secrets, making him a repository of shipboard rumors and tales, though he's known to never spill a word of it to the wrong ears.

Cook George "Spoon" Langley

* He is French. George De Langue  
* Spoon is known for his ability to juggle: knives, live chickens, or even large cookpots. He does this in front of the crew whenever they ask, typically every meal. He can do five knives.

Quartermaster Igor Ivanov, "Igor"

* Third son of a second son of a two generation emigre.  
* Big vodka drinker \- distills it discretely in barrels

20 scientific and military experts

* Sir William Francis Patrick Napier
