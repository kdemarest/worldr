## Ship Routines

* **Watches:** Day and night watches are posted, one man fore and one aft, unless at need the guard be doubled.  
* **Cleanliness**: Sailors are regularly stripped, shaved, scrubbed, and issued clean clothes and bedding, reducing Typhus  
* **Beer**: Sailor get a gallon of weak beer daily. The beer, having been boiled, lasts for months free of bacteria, unlike water. That means 0.1 ton of beer per sailor per month; tropical water sources are often marshy and malarial  
* **Boiling**: Educated sailors understand how to boil salt water to make it pure, and can make-shift a solar heating apparatus for the purpose.
