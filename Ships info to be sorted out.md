# **New Ship**

24 crew complement.

# **Layout & Equipment**

The Mercy is a Lateen Rigged Caravel. (ship speeds)

**Caravel**: The caravel was a small highly-maneuverable sailing ship developed in the 15th century by the Portuguese to explore along the West African coast and into the Atlantic Ocean. The lateen sails gave it speed and the capacity for sailing windward.

**Hull**: Copper plated, reducing drag from fouling weed and barnacles

**Sails**: Efficient triangular sails, capable of sailing windward

**Joints**: Iron joints and bolts reduced flex and improve sailing speeds, and sea worthiness.

**Speed**: 100 miles/day with favorable winds (4 knots average, with a top speed of 8 knots). The very fastest ships of the day could make 14 knots. [deets](https://qz.com/1193455/the-speed-of-europes-18th-century-sailing-ships-is-revamping-historians-view-of-the-industrial-revolution/)

**Armament**: 3x 8 Pounder Cannons; 1x Bow 9 Pounder w/extra range

Captain's Cabin: Hanging in the Captain's cabin is this [Van Eyck](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/33/Van_Eyck_-_Arnolfini_Portrait.jpg). The dog in the painting is sometimes missing. At these times, the identical-looking ship's dog can be found.

Figurehead: A bare chested woman ([pic](https://miro.medium.com/max/500/1*yr2Zt2sVZOmRwOsga-e4pw.png)) holds a lantern to light the way. Each night the lantern is lit, and each morning it is doused. The figureheard resembles Maria Fitzherbert in her younger days.

Crew's Quarters: Mostly hammocks tethered to vertical spars. Each sailor gets a locker (a chest) for their own personal items.

Magazine: Storage of gun powder
