# Agamorphon (Second ward)
PIC@

Origin: Mycenaean King Agamemnon, formerly Minoan granted long life from 2500-1300 BC  
- Both Mycenaeans and Minoans are completely unknown to Europe at this time (1870)  
- The labyrinthine nature of trees reflects the labyrinth at Knossos  
- The "change" core power of the second ward parallels the idea of a twisting labyrinth  
- Corrupted at the time of Iphigenia's Sacrifice.  

300 feet tall (100m), and 60' across on land. In sea roots extend 100' around for floatation and swimming, and it is only 150' tall.  

Health - 100 + can kill 30 hangers a round (# of spirits ensnared in vines)  
- Has 210 total hangers on  
- King George on his shoulders PIC in a pavilion  

Armor - trunk 6, branches 4, roots 2, eyes zero.

200 yards = DC 9, +1 for each additional 100 yards

## Layers
- Hangers on - jovines erupt from the skin like freakish hair, each penetrating the mouth (and guts) of a victim, typically an Andromorph that wears an expression of bliss  
- Jovines - reminiscent of the Minoan snake goddess, but malign.  
- Thread - the outermost woody skin is a layer of spirit thread. Breaching this enables weapons that harm sentients to work.  
  - Weaving it open by hand is possible  
  - Striking it with other weapons creates the illusion that the thread is separated, but it is a deception. DC 7 spirit perception to notice.  
- Thin bark (roots) see below  
- Truck bark see below  
- Pulp - damage done without bark defenses is doubled  
- Maze - interior maze with the minotaur  
- Mind - the crypt with black opal Agamemnon (inert)

## Defenses
- Bronze flesh - it can choose a local 40' in diameter and give that zone bronze skin, adding 3 to its armor in that region  
- Heal self - take a round to destroy up to 30 hangers on  
- Root sphere (on land) - be still and extend a spherical root web around self. See roots below  
- Root disc (on sea) - extends a radius of roots in the water, keeping ships and most enemies away  
- Roots - passing through a web of roots or branches requires slow movement, as difficult terrain. Roots may have Jovines among them.

## Perception
- Vision - It sees with two glowing eyes, and sees thermally  
- Touch - It can feel things that touch any part of it, but if transforming or if there are a large number of touches it may not distinguish well.  
- Vibrations - It senses movement vibrations. Sans eyes you become invisible if you stay still. Detecting movement in water only works within 20', and it a round late.

## Attacks
- Spirit attacks vs. Body Autonomy  
  - Difficulty 9 / 8 / 7  
  - D can roll when interposing a spirit with his companions.  
- Root Grab  
  - DC 7 might or speed  
  - Sudden reach - a branch can reach up to 100'  
  - Within 50m it will grab with roots the masts, sails, guns, etc. but it can be distracted by PCs on deck, and will prefer them.  
- Morph - DC 7 (vs body autonomy)  
- Reshape - DC 5 vs Might - nearby living creatures, granting them aggression, natural weapons, greater craftiness in their tactics.  
- Jovine Fusilades  
  - Once every ten rounds, From his head can launch 7 Jovines, DC 5 which writhe about and seek to enter enemies (vs speed)

## Weaknesses
- The Double Axe (Labrys) PIC was a powerful symbol in Minoan culture. Applying one to the thread always splits it, and any weapon so shaped always negates all armor.  
- Eyes are entrances to the maze.  
- Spirit Fruit - fruit growing on the ends of the branches, when consumed, restore 15 points of player pool. You must also resist Chaos DC 6 or suffer bad luck for four rounds.

# Akrafo (Ashanti Soul Washer)
PIC (badge)

Cast gold disks called akrafokonmu ("soul washer's disk") are worn as protective emblems by important members of the court, including royal attendants known as akrafo, or "soul washers." Individuals selected for this title are beautiful young men and women born on the same day of the week as the king. Worthy of serving the king in light of their youth and vigor, they ritually purify and replenish the king's vital powers and, in doing so, help to stabilize and protect the nation.

# Anansi Kese
A giant spider god, the deification of Anansi the trickster, capable of spinning inanimate men from its spinnerets. Anansi is a trickster, but also the creator of the first, inanimate men.

# Andromorph
Humans that have been corrupted into hybrid forms. They are typically sad, fearful and cowardly unless they can ambush or have clear advantage. Not great fighters. Their speech is terrible.

## Types
**Bat Man (Vesperna) T:3** - fly, glide and climb  
**Bird Man (Tangata, pic) T:2** - glide only; rotten feathers  
**Fish Man (Tangika) T:2** - v fast swim  
**Iguana Man (Mokata, pic, pic) T:4** - fast swim, poison bite, tail whip 6 dmg, third parietal eye makes them very hard to sneak up on; color change; like a marine iguana, not a tree dweller. Extended lifespan

## Attitudes
- They see anyone spirit wielding as a Spirit Master, to be obeyed. They will bow and scrape, looking mournfully at the spirit master, groveling and doing whatever they are told. They generally try to touch and paw at Spirit Masters.  
- Anyone with religious, mind control and spirit purging or inserting power is seen as a Changer, like the ones that made them.

Eventually they will lose their awe, if they are not commanded and dealt with harshly as they expect from the Spirit Masters. When Lucius goes to renew communication, it will bite off his hand.

# Anglerwhale
PIC  
Deep ocean denizen. Their light emits ultrabright invisible UV that blinds the unshielded. Their spear like teeth cage their prey, who are gulped down and digested slowly. Optical vision. A huge angler will bite through the hull, creating 1pt of leaks per bite.

# African Golden Cat
PIC  
Tier 1  
Kept as pets in the palace of the Ashanti.

# Ashanti Warrior
PIC  
Tier 2

# Austra
PIC MALE, PIC FEMALE  
The Australopithecus, still to be found in the depths of the African jungle, are an extremely peaceful society living in harmony with nature. Intelligent, gentle, and very strong, the Austa are dwindling due to the technological innovations and depredations of the natives.

### Motivation
The overwhelming motivation of the Austra is to do what is best for the community. They are peaceful, work constantly for the good of others, cooperative above all else, and self-sacrificing. They never attack, always flee if possible, and if attacked fight fiercely. If captured they will always attempt escape. If coerced into work they always resist and ultimately suicide, so that their community will be known as useless for slavery. While they are pleased to compete for excellence as a game, it must be something worth competing for.

### Lifestyle
The Austa live in utter harmony with nature, in an almost utopian way. They kill only old animals past breeding age, farm fruits and vegetables by cultivating jungle trees.

### Technology
Animal traps, plant cultivation, animal breeding, run-free pet and herd animal domestication, sustainable homes, counting to ten but no zero.  
Shelter: PIC1, PIC2, PIC3

### Moral Code
- Everything for the community  
- Kill only what you need, sustainably  
- Serve others first to invigorate the 

# Barrel Eye
Deep ocean dweller.  
PIC  
Only about 3' in length, they are extra hard to spot (-3 to detect). Mostly they cause alarming bumping noises on the sub's surface, and obstruct weapons if not detected.

# Black Skull
PIC - the Black Skull  
In general, black relics are some kind of bone, often a skull; some are bundles of hair, or a dried tongue. Often adorned with symbolic metals and/or opaque gemstones, some of which may grant it powers. BRs vary in their function.

Tier 5-9  
Movement: Fly at walk/run/gallop/sparrow flight pace (can accel each round)  
Abilities: Invisibility, Overthrow, Control, Reassemble  
All subject to the rules of magic.  
Abilities: Deflect, Pain, Purge  
Vulnerability: If attacked while overthrowing, gain +2 ease  

### Black relics share the following principles:
- Overthrow - can commence at a time of the Relic's choosing  
- Touching - When one touches a black relic one suffers blind, deaf, or mute. Overthrow attempts may start immediately. See Overthrow below.  
- Bright light - Surround it with bright light and it can not "reach" the outer world to influence it until there is a gap in the light.  
- Burning - The fire's heat is transferred to all within sight distance.  
- Smashing - Diff 4 unless the relic specifies otherwise. It will make a crack like thunder. All that hear it from Short distance must roll defense vs difficulty 5 or be nearly deafened for a week (-4 hearing perception, -1 to be stealthy). A failed smash renders you unconscious for 2 rounds and you drop the relic.

### Invisibility
At will the BR can become invisible to senses, except touch. It can not attack in this state. If one detects it, it seems as if mottled shadows cover it in an explicable way. It still physically exists in a location.

### Overthrow
Roll defense (int) each round to avoid overthrow. Animals of lower tier are automatically overthrown. One victim can be overthrown at a time, unless the BR has been storing up power - then all in an 20' area must roll. The BT must be still and not invisible to attack. Difficulty varies as follows:  
- 2h an avatar of the corruptor is present  
- 1h touching or using a biological interface  
- 0e not touching, but within sight distance  
- 1e lead at least 1", or gold at least 1/8" between the mind and the relic  
- 1e for each foot of stone substantially between mind and relic  
- 7e lead or gold completely surrounding the mind (and thus the body also)  
- ?e certain assets/objects give a bonus against overthrow, not to exceed +2

### Darklands
When overthrown, a PC will experience a personal nightmare, typically consisting of:  
- A series of tasks with which they have skill  
- Tasks suited to another PC. They must gain the Swap Nightmares ability  

Succeeding at a Darklands nightmare weakens the BR, even (roll=19/20) taking it over for a round and enables another roll to unshackle.

Objectives never include killing anything, or ignoring suffering. Killing anything puts you into stage 1 Control. Can include:  
- Touch the BR in their dream  
- Save an innocent  
- Show a kindness

### Control
**Round 1**  
**Rounds 1–5:** The target will collapse and leak dark spirit from their mouth.  
**Rounds 6–10:** The target will additionally convulse; dark spirits break their body  
**Rounds 10+:** Stage One (no more dark spirits are visible)  
**Rounds 20+:** Stage Two  
**Rounds 30+:** Stage Three  

**Stage One:** The target will stand and act calmly as directed by the BR; All life is forgotten, all relationships. You can be lead around but do not respond.  

**Stage Two:** The entity acts vigorously in the best interests of the black relic, as it perceives those interests, but does not attack  

**Stage Three:** The entity can attack.

Note: There is no magic communication with the black relic, nor with other overthrown (though they can recognize each other), nor does the relic have a mind as such. Retries to become unshackled are not allowed unless a significant occurrence happens. If the relic is destroyed all those overthrown may Roll <tier> each round until freed.

### Reassemble
For each hour the relic is apart it can move 1% of itself back together, requiring just over 4 days to assemble. It will tend to choose the most advantageous place to reassemble.

### Deflect
Incoming projectiles can be deflected. Roll 7 to overcome this.

### Pain
A 20' AoE attack causing targets to freeze up in agony, clutching the BR tightly whence it will tend to launch more attacks. On a 1-4 an extended effect can occur: Blindness, Deafness, or struck Mute each for two days.

### Purge
At will the BR can selectively kill all sentients overthrown for a month or more within a ten mile radius. Roll 7 to resist.

# Cerulean Bees
PIC PIC  
Tier 3, Health n/a, Armor 1  

A swarm or hive has 10,000 to 60,000 bees, enough to coat 2 to 12 people.  
10,000 bees weighs the same as a person; 5,000 bees can "coat" a person  

Bees with blue instead of yellow stripes. They make a much lower hum than usual - you can feel it in your sternum. The hives are typically large, about three times the size of a honey bee.

### Defenses
- AoE - Only AoE works against the bees.  
- Fire - a torch keeps them away in a 5' radius  
- Smoke - makes those it comes into contact with peaceful

### Attacks
**Coating** - In one round, 5,000 bees can "coat" a man. The next round, their droning hum disrupts the nervous system, requiring 1/2/4 might to be spent in order to move short/med/long, and requiring 1 might to act.

### Crafting
**Sensitizer:** The honey is a sensitizer. Everything around the eater becomes ultra clear, ultra defined, ultra loud. Pain hurts twice as much. Unless one wraps up eyes, ears

# Creeper
Tier 5  
After a visit by an Inquisitor, or in other circumstances, these will infest the area and follow the party.

### Aversion
It requires Reality Discipline DC 6 to even know it is there, and a further DC7 to look directly at it. Perception can be included.

### Sapping
They grip the skull of mook crew during sleep, from the crown of the head, gripping the ears and drawing out the breath (and spirit) over the course of an hour with little tweezer like claws that reach around to the front. If you walk in on one you have to make a DC4 perception check to see the claws in the ears and the claws drawing breath will be withdrawn and hidden. After Sapping the remains are a Skin Monster.

# Dahlverna
creatureType: Twisted
faction: Andromorph
PIC  
A dolphin-man mix.

# Dutch Agent
Tier 3, Health 9, Armor 1  
- **Morbid Fascination** - Roll 4s victim becomes fascinated to see a human suffer and die, even if it is their own self. Feels like you are something else, looking through your own eyes. You feel a deep fear of humans. They all need to die. Gahan is already +2 Specialized against it, while Constance has a -1 Inability.  
- **Sneak** - roll 3s, +1 trained,+1 boisterous party  
- **Thrown knife** - Roll 4s, +1 trained, +1 from shadows, +1 if target distracted.  
- **Garrotte lunge** - Roll 4s, +1 trained, +1 from shadows or from behind. Inflicts 4m per round. Roll 6 to escape. Victim may not shout.  
- **Poison Pills** - All have poison pills in their mouths to suicide if caught.

# Charlie the Chimpanda

Tier 5, Health 30, Armor 2

# Emela-Ntouka
Pic. A large horned quadruped lizard the size of a small elephant, reported to kill anything it sees. Of course that can't be true, but it does tend to hunt the largest herbivores and carnivores that it can find.

# Fante Warrior
PIC

# Flickering Jelly
VID mute, VID, VID  
The "dogs" of the Zocto  
A form of Comb Jelly, these mesmerize the viewer, who will stop all activities to simply watch. In addition, long trailers are sticky and can catch moving prey that does not actively avoid them. Thermal vision. A grazing by tentacles does 1d3

## Floaters [Jovian]
Methane filled blimp-like creatures hover in the lower atmosphere. Sulphur consuming bacteria thrive in hovering globs of liquid ammonia.

## Forest Hog, Giant
Link. 5–8' long with 14" tusks. Unlikely to attack unless cornered or babies are threatened. Come in dounders of 12–18. All members of the sounder protect the piglets. Males can attack without warning, and mating contests often leave one dead.

**Charge**  
**Head butt**  
**Tusk slash**

## Frilled Shark
PIC

## Gelada
**Level:** 4  
**Health:** 14  
**Damage:** 5  
**Ability:** Throw victim, Intimidate 5, Rip Off Limb  
**Ability:** Climb, Brachiate, Leap, Move silently, Nimble (roll 5 to nab)

## Gecko, Fan-Toed
PIC  
Geckos are strange, wide-toed, hand-sized lizards that feed on moths and mosquitos. Befriending a gecko can lead to one of each of the following gecko traits becoming available each day the gecko is kept (and well treated). The price for using one is that for a day you will slow down in cooler temperatures.

* Lidless, they lick their own eyeballs to keep them moist.
* Excellent night vision, 350× a human
* Traverse even smooth vertical surfaces or smooth ceilings with ease
* Able to lose their tail and regrow it (as a cypher this is a limb)
* Dermal flap enabling incredible camouflage against wood
* Presence will resist mosquito problems for a day
* Super hydrophobic and anti-bacterial skin
* Sheds skin every two weeks by loosening and then eating it

## Glass Octopus [Jovian]
PIC  
A roaming spirit of a Zocto on earth, seeking to return to Jupiter to rest.

## Ghost Squid
PIC  
Perceives sound and light. Takes 3 rounds to wrap the object, then starts emitting acid that slowly weakens where its suckers grasp the hull, causing leaks, acidic gas leaking into the craft harming the crew, and eventually implosion.

## Golem
There are lots of golems in use by the Corruptor, from very small ones that plague naturals to huge ones like the Easter Island statues. A mage can make a golem, but the most common manifestation is to find an object possessed by the Corruptor.

* It is important that each golem variety have a weakness which, when exploited, wilts or disables the golem.

The Corruptor can control inanimate things as Golems, passively or directly.

* The closer an item is to the shape of a living creature, the easier to control. For example, a doll is easiest, a wooden sawhorse difficult, but an anvil would never be a golem.
* Golems typically have a weakness which, when exploited, deactivates the golem. For those made for good, it is typically the Golem's name embedded in the forehead.
* Many golems are made by putting a living thing into the golem and then letting it die of thirst.
* Golems are frequently distractible with water, wanting to drink it or destroy it in anger when they can not drink.

## Goliath Crab [Jovian]
PIC@  
Babies wrap themselves into an egg shape PIC@  
Adults are up to 150' tall.

Found in groups, and often mistaken for the stems of tall kelp, until they move. Goliaths resemble Japanese spider crabs, striding the sea floor on tall spindly legs. Crushing claws so strong they can collapse even the original Zocto pressure suits. They have a gap near the hinge, offering a chance at life to those who spot it. Clack claws to see with sonar.

* Can grapple but not harpoon.
* A successful grab of the sub (vs maneuvers) in a claw does 1 pt per turn until that section's hull is destroyed.

## Grimpus Imperator [Jovian]
PIC aka the Emperor Dumbo  
A corrupted form of Zocto. Ranging from 3' to 20', these dumb looking creatures see thermally and grasp anything that moves. Often found riding on larger creatures, scavenging the barnacles and algae from their skin, they will attach to the sub. For each Grimpteuthis attached:

* –1 roll to steering and acceleration
* –1 when giving commands, as the thudding of the animal's four hearts echoes through the hull

## Grumbler
PIC  
A cursed creature that brings the paranoid grumbling of the Corruptor into the mind. It manifests as sharkbirds, which are very easy to kill, but ever-present behind a screen of reality distortion.

## Hagmen
creatureType: Twisted
faction: Andromorph
PIC  
Humans morphed with hagfish.

## Hump Back Whale
Peaceful. Useful to hide behind, generate a chum field, hitch a harpoon ride, drag into adversaries.

## Ionian Commoner [Jovian Civilization]
PIC@  
The Ionians are sentient snail-like organisms with iron shells. For reference see the oceanic volcanic snails of earth. The average Ionian lives in that shell all their life, while those born to Noble status live within special robotic shells. See Ionian Noble.

The species of Io, a silicon fire-based life form. They used to be suit-makers, until the Corruptor started supplying suits that control the nobles.

Their technology was incredible BUT as slaves to the Corruptor they work at an 1850s level, so although they look formidable their armors are under-powered. They also colonized Jupiter long ago.

Since their preferred habitations were so different (above and below the sea) they seldom clashed. Although the Ioans resisted the Corruptor almost immediately, it blasted their moon, cracking it open and turning it into the volcanic hell-scape it is today. They capitulated, and were rapidly enslaved and used to drive the Zocto out.

The Ioans are masters of automatons, and crafted the blue crystals one finds within such robotic hosts.

## Ionian Noble [Jovian Civilization]
PIC, PIC  
The Ionians are slug-like organisms, in metallic snail shells when young. While the average Ionian lives in that shell all their life, the nobles are "extracted" through a gruesome process to inhabit their noble metal bodies.

Although the metal armor lets them live a really long time, it also contains numerous tiny, hidden golem crystals which help the Corruptor control all of the ionian leadership.

There are 100,000. Irella doesn't know about souls. But the injustice of their situation means there is a great deal of haunting.

### Nobles Seen At the Venus Party
**"Sigma"** – 200 years old. They choose when they die

* Here to share technology.

**Gamma** – the tall one, is 2,000 years  
* They can disassemble and reassemble their mechanical parts, but they believe they have an immortal soul.  
* They hunger for knowledge.  
* They use as little metal as possible so they can have as many people as possible. But they lack metal.

### Noble Encountered on Io
Irella details

## Inquisitor (form of the Corruptor)
**Tier:** 12  
A gripping, clawing presence. It relays anything it learns to the Corruptor for use against the victim.

1. Can't be looked at directly dc12, nor named. Defeat with Reality Discipline dc6  
2. Seeks to know the intent of the viewer, invading their mind dc12 vs Intention Shield  
3. Secondarily it tries to understand what you want most, to use against you later.  
4. Leaves behind about five to ten Creepers.  
5. Leaves a compulsion on n the market and on anyone who rolls a 1 during confrontation: to addictively attempt to re-view the GRS.

## Mariners (Orca-like Sophonts)
**Basic:** PIC, after being freed: PIC, PIC  
Without body PIC  
**Tier:** 5–7 avg 6  
**Health:** 70  
**Armor:** 1  
**35 mph swim**

### Mariner Septem
**BIG SECRET** – they devolved themselves, and have suffered three million years under a situation they voluntarily entered. It was NOT the Purifex, although they were the indirect cause.

**OTHER BIG SECRET** – Their apparent orca bodies are not really them. They're the organo-tech cybernetic filaments, capable of cybernetically merging with most life forms.

The Mariners, seven immortals who can never reproduce:

* They evolved in the oceans of Mars, converted the planet by extraction of their space ship, and then the Purifex showed up. So they created the earth between Mars and Venus as a defense.
* Need to return to their earth center orb to regain space travel and the ability to manipulate objects, and bring all the human souls collected by the soul collector for use in the Solution.
* Discover that the Corruptor is the created creature of the Purifex.
* There the party can regain one of the other ships, and the Mariners can enable it to travel, first to Jupiter  
  * Use spiritual means to Redirect the power of the 2nd, 5th and 8th wards to power one of the Solutions; fight Ionians and Moai, but also see the vast emptiness and the encircling cities.

**Origin:** The Orca are devolved Mariner descendants reshaped by the Second Ward (in an ancient incarnation), and under the influence of Mind Corruption. The playthings of the Shaper, Orca are being bred to out-compete humanity. They already breathe air; all they need to do is swim through the air...

They evolved in the former oceans of Mars, once a completely water planet, converted the planet by extraction of their space ship, and then the Purifex showed up. So they created the earth between Mars and Venus as a defense.

**Motivation:** The Orca come to help the players, but their minds have been twisted. They will sometimes manage to help, but it will always involve attacks and harm to the players or their cause. But the Orca can't see it.

**Spirit:** They are sentients, but because they represent the last seven of their race their "meta spirit" is fairly present. Anyone able to contact animals can also contact the remaining Mariners. If contacted (before being saved) they will project an image of an iron sphere, and communicate their grave pleasure in doing their duty to avert corruption and aid the resistance, while harming the players.

**Age:** They are 3 million years old.

### Capabilities
* Phobia – they are traumatized from 3 million years of insanity.
* Survival – Orca can survive in space, on Jupiter, Venus, almost anywhere. They resist cold, radiation, and withstand high pressures.
* Breathing – They can store O2 reserves compressed as liquid in their bodies, and filter Oxygen from almost anything, and if there isn't O2 around they will crush rocks or ice to extract the oxygen from the water.
* Frost Swim – Orca can swim in even fairly light densities. Not air, but the clouds of Jupiter, the vapor on Venus, the ice rings of Saturn, or the seas on earth.
* Hibernate – After using clouds and orbital pull to gain speed, the Orca can hibernate in the deep cold of space to cross mighty distances towards where a planet will be in many months or years time.
* Signaling – In addition to long distance water communication, and air communication, the white stripes on Orca glow in rapid patterns that can be interpreted as speech, e.g., in space.
* Coordination – exceptionally crafty, the Orca can plan and execute together.
* Water Leap – up to 30' in the air from out the sea
* Head Butt – 4
* Bite and Toss – 6
* Bite and Drag – 6 + 3 for a second round unless the character escapes
* Explosion – When stabbed for 25 or more points, or when slain with edged weapons, an Orca will explode due to the compressed O2 in its blubber, inflicting 20 points of damage at point blank range.

# Kikiyaon
PIC

A large owl-like creature with a name that translates to **"soul cannibal."** Its creepy call might follow you for days, and then you will find a party member comatose. Until the next sunrise the kikiyaon may not leave the vicinity, as it tears the soul from the victim, so it will hide. If you hunt the creature down and wound it, it may negotiate to release the victim's soul. It typically seeks another soul, a blood letting, or the destruction of a beloved object. While in such discussions, it will vanish and reappear at other locations. If you were looking directly at it, you don't remember it vanishing.

**Noise:** creepy #2  
* Beak  
* Raking claws  
* Wing spurs  

**Feather** – A feather from a kikiyaon aids in hiding or moving stealthily from place to place, and protects against any kikiyaon that sees the feather.

**Beak** – Ground up beak will make a coma-inducing poison or dust cloud.

**Spurs** – Properly converted they can be used to inoculate against sleep, coma, confusion, or similar insensibility. It lasts one encounter. Many people can be inoculated, but only 13 total before the effect is gone.

# Kraken
PIC

Grabs and squeezes things to death. It will tend to go after suited divers first, trapping them, requiring saving by the submarine.

# Leopard
Moderately sized, will typically avoid humans in a group, but might spring on one alone if hungry. Mostly prized for the coat, but quick, quiet, and elusive.

# Meduseloid
PIC  
**Tier 4**

A fist-sized blob-like hemisphere that is a differentiated single-celled colony. It glows with a warm light. It slowly moves, scouring with a light acid anything it crosses to clean it.

**Adaptation** – Can live in vacuum and numerous atmospheres, extremely resilient.

**Mobile** – Slow, but can fit through even tiny holes in about a minute. It does wait on each side for its "self" to fully move through a hole before proceeding.

**Tough** – Cutting or even shooting it does it no harm. Burning does half damage. Cold and zero pressure is its native habitat.

**Consuming** – If it can crawl onto a creature (for example during sleep, starting on a hand, foot, or head) it will secrete an acid with an anesthetic, consuming the creature while it sleeps but can't feel anything. For mooks it will get about half done in a night. For higher levels, it might reach a wrist or elbow.

# Mega-Sponge
PIC

So big the entire Nautilus can fit through its holes. Not just a living colony, it travels the sea floor leaving a shallow trench in its wake. Often found above lava tubes so it can benefit from the heat.

# Moai [Jovian]
PIC, PIC in pit, PIC standing, PIC sentinels with hats, PIC many

Stone men Easter Island statues, animated by one to five shackled spirits. The largest is 70' tall and weighs 250 tons. Sqrt(h)^3/2. A Moai can only live if a spirit is shackled to it.

* Nearly immortal  
* Incredibly strong  

# Myrmecoleon
PIC LINK

A dangerous creature purported to exist from Greek times.

> “There is a stone in the sea which is called in Latin *mermecoleon* and in Greek *concasabea*, because it is both hollow and round. It is, moreover, divided into two parts, so that if it wants to, it can close up. The stone lies at the bottom of the sea and comes to life early in the morning. When it rises from its resting-place to the surface of the sea, it opens its mouth and takes in some heavenly dew, and the rays of the sun shine around it; thus there grows within the stone a most precious, shining pearl indeed, conceived from the heavenly dew and given lustre by the rays of the sun."

# Vesperna
creatureType: Twisted
faction: Andromorph
Living: PIC@, PIC@  
Skeleton: PIC@

Tier 3-6  
Touch: out of combat, touch smears Transformation Horror or Histoplasmosis on the victim.  
Bite: 3m but 2 easier to hit the following round. Transmits Transformation Horror.  
Rake: 4m rake by clawed hands. May not be flying. Conveys Histoplasmosis.  
Grab: 2s talons grab; required to lift or toss  
Toss: Target is grabbed with talons and thrown up to 10'. Vesperna suffers 2 disable  
Lift: Target must first be grabbed, then can be lifted and flown at half or quarter speed.

Weird, diseased bat-morphed men. Werebats, in a way. Around their necks they carry a natural white paste of the disease Histoplasmosis, and another of Transformation Horror, which they will try to rub against human opponents, who they will then generally ignore.

**Transformation Horror:** at an appropriate time, the victim and those around will perceive them to be transforming into a Vesperna. A coin under the tongue is proof against this.

A **Reality Distortion** comes into effect:

* Anyone wounded by a vesperna transforms into a man bat in one round. They are in agony and must roll DC 7 int (willpower) to take actions while changing.  
* Anyone touched by a vesperna transforms in two rounds. The first round, although they feel it happening, they may act. Subsequent rounds they must roll.

Once in Vesperna form, all vesperna attacks are available: bite, rake, talon grab, lift/drop and toss; The mind becomes cloudy, and but no regular human attacks are available.

Histoplasmosis symptoms include lip and gum ulcers, leading to decrease white blood cell counts and bone marrow failure. For game purposes, it means bones that snap trivially (5 or more m or s damage in one blow)

# Wax Man
Tier 1 to 4  
Health 6\*t, Armor 1

Wax Men are made from household wax combined with phosphorous (a waxy element that glows in the dark). Jupiter's great red spot is also substantially phosphorous, sealing the connection of wax man golems to the Corruptor.

Wax men are often deceptive, pretending death quickly to survive and then rejuvenate.

There are variants:

* **The Phosphene Wax Man** can burst into flame. When chopped or sliced pieces burst into flame and may strike enemies. It can "smear" itself over victims like napalm, but it is damaged when doing so. Flaming pieces damage at 3m/round. It glows in the dark like this: VIDEO  
* **The Blob** moves through small spaces and under doors, forming only rough humanoid features. Its touch chemically scalds the skin.

**Abilities:**  
* Malleable: Heals from regular damage within 1 hour, unless very cold  
* Not Alive: immunity from starvation, disease, etc.  
* Vague Mind: gain +2 vs mind related magic  
* Morphous: cutting off limbs and such doesn't matter, except the loss of mobility and use of weapons.  
* Collapse: at will can collapse into melted wax unrecognizable as a person, especially to avoid discovery. May then use Malleable to re-form.

**Vulnerabilities:**  
* Projectile Immunity: arrows and bullets do no damage as they simply enter the wax.  
* Bash Resist: bashing weapons do 1 point, plus any bonuses  
* Fire: prolonged heat melts them with double damage, eventually disrupting the wax enough to kill the entity.  
* Cold: cooling will slow them to half speed or worse; Cryogenic temperatures halt them, and a blow will shatter such, destroying it.

Acts as a natural human in all ways. Examination at Short distance will reveal with roll 5.

* Snag or grab a human at DC 5.  
* Yanking one out by its roots is DC 6.

Yovines also grow from Orongo, acting as cradles for transforming andromorphs.

Yovines are capable of entwining a sleeping human in about 15 minutes, gradually turning them into humaniform Jovines. One can be partially turned, in which case your living vine arm will seek to wrap about your neck and throttle you.

They were originally Jovians, ousted when the Corruptor arrived. Their advanced ultra-civilization fled through the First Ward's gate to earth's deep oceans, using the steampunk armored pressure suits to survive until they could swim to earth's deepest ocean caves. But natural predators keep them primitive and disorganized. More such suits can be found in Syzygy, the now-abandoned place of first landing.

## Natural Creatures

Originally natives of the volcanic floor of Europa's sub-ice oceans, the Zocto colonized Jupiter millions of years ago. While the Europans are spindly and light, the Zocto have evolved (and were engineered) to be strong and malleable while remaining flexible to accommodate Jupiter's 2.4x gravity.

Other creatures live in natural ice cracks, geyser pools, and dug tunnels in Europa's 10 mile thick ice.

They are resistant to the morphing capabilities of Changers.

* One tentacle is poorly functioning  
* It can shoulder-mount up to two implosion torpedoes, each requiring an arm to hold.  
* It has sonar imaging
