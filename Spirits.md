# Spirits

The spirits of men and beasts are mysterious. In time all mortals shed the husk of their mortal coil, yielding up their unique spirit. When such spirits are "clear" they float upward, vanishing to an unknown destiny. But a "clouded" spirit must remain to haunt the living.

The impact of such spirits upon the material world is tenuous, until harnessed by a mage for evil or for good.

## Ether

Ether (aka spirit ether) permeates the space around all matter. Spirits are concentrated ether and light catalyzed by their existence.

## **Spirits** {#spirits}

The material form of an entity is called the "husk", which the spirit occupies. Spirits may never be created except by nature. Nearing death makes the spirit visible as it dissociates from the husk. Material death frees the sentient spirit, which slowly rises and (probably) dissolves into ether.

### **Spirit Types** {#spirit-types}

* Sentient \- Sentience coalesces ether into spirit, tethered by nature to the husk that carries the mind until death frees the spirit  
* Notable Living Things \- A specific living thing of significance, eg the spirit of the eldest oak, which is an extension of the spirit of its class but acts independently.  
* Beast \- Species with volition coalesce ether into Animal Spirits, one for each type of animal, connected to their ecosystems. Eg the spirit of foxes, or of horses.  
* Living Things \- Also grouped by type, like the spirit of oak trees.  
* Nature \- The spirit of the wind, or rain or thunder.

### **Haunting** {#haunting}

Spirits are to be found in the world primarily due to hauntings, that is, upon death spirits spontaneously bind to a place, object, or entity due to strong emotion, will power, extreme trauma, karmic injustice, or an unresolved critical task.

### **Connecting** {#connecting}

Through magery an entity can connect to one or more spirits, or manipulate such spirits, as follows:

* Tether \- Be tethered willingly by a light Spirit Master  
* Shackle \- Be shackled unwillingly by a dark Spirit Master, bent to the master's will.  
* Bind \- Be bound to a golem body via blue crystal (dark)  
* Confine \- Be contained within a runed pentahedron or vessel  
* Meld \- Be combined with another spirit in an abomination, typically by a Spirit Changer.  
* Stitch \- A left-over bit of spirit can be stitched to an object, like a shield or figurine. Bound spirits can then be used in magic, as described in the book Spirit Magic

## Weaving

Under the hands of a very skilled mage, ether can be woven into Strands, which can be:

* Spirit cloaks and spirit armor  
* Bonds to bind two spirits together in an abomination, like sewing a man and a beast  
* Woven with matter via runes, to create containing structures, portal wormholes, and gravity envelopes.

## Spirit Cloaking {#spirit-cloaking}

I'm thinking that somebody, maybe St B, some illuminati, and a priest of Djoser, have been working to enable spirit cloaking. Gahan's savantism, Lucius decryption, and Henton s spirit mastery combine to solve the final puzzles and eventually produce spirit cloaks.

Trips to Jupiter first in the Zocto suit, but eventually the true path is to "clothe yourself in spirit armor". Aka spirit cloaking.

Spirit cloaks can be leveled with experience, to avoid the gaze of soul collectors, to repel the diamond rain, against specific wards perhaps, gain control of automatons or inhabit/drive them as vehicles, survive vacuum and cold.

Just as the sphere frame has parts that are between the spirit world and material world, so go the spirit cloaks. Only Reality Discipline or Seeing the Unseen can reveal them. In the material world you'll be apparently walking on Jupiter with no special gear.

## **Spirits Rules** {#spirits-rules}

Some spirits are **active** (requiring easier difficulty from 1 to 3 to sense), but most are Dormant, meaning that they are (generally roll 8\) not visible and not accessible to a mage. A spirit that is active can be spoken with and potentially tethered.

No magic exists without some component of spirit or ether driving it, and ether magic is never "active".

### **Spirit Characteristics** {#spirit-characteristics}

The souls of the dead struggle to pierce the veil of the living, creating the following general characteristics. Some magic abilities break these guidelines:

1. **Formless:** Spirits don't interact with matter, in general. They have no form, for example they are not 'human shaped'. They are non-local, that is, there is no particular "point in space" that a spirit occupies. Matter may not touch spirits.  
2. **Detectable:** Most sentients can not perceive spirits unless the spirit is "strongly manifest". However, a mage with Sense Spirit can, to the extent described in that ability. Most spirits are deeply Dormant (roll 8), but a few, for whatever reason, are more easily sensible. See Sense Spirit for details. (Sense Spirit)  
3. **KNOWN Listeners:** Spirits may listen to you, or not, but they are constrained by language similar to any entity. They can perceive motions, for example pantomime. It is possible to communicate with some spirits with telepathy.   
4. **Tethering**: Spirits may be coaxed into service (Tethering). Once serving, they are utterly bound to do their master's will, but they can do it lazily, inaccurately, or poorly. They can depart at the next full moon.  
5. **Enslavement**: Spirits can be forced by an evil act into servitude. Unlike tethering, enslavement doesn't require the spirit to agree. See below.  
6. **Resisting:** Entities of matter may resist the effects of spirits (by their tier).  
7. **KNOWN Blocking**: Spirit motion is blocked by "dense elements", which are thin gold or thick lead. Helmets help resist, but only utterly surrounding a mind (and thus the rest of the body) can completely exclude spirits. A hole the size of a lock will slow spirit one round. The seam in a poorly fit coffin will slow it two rounds. See "substances".  
8. **Attracting**: Spirits yearn for sulphur (per Paracelsus), and can be distracted by it. See "substances".  
9. **Types**: Animal and plant spirits are different than sentient spirits.  
10. **Undeath**: The spirits of the dead never return to life. It is a one way journey.

### **Spirit General Abilities** {#spirit-general-abilities}

1. **Manifesting**: Spirits may temporarily manifest, making them able to push or touch matter. The reverse is not true \- matter may not touch the spirit. Many effects require the spirit to slightly manifest, giving an asset to detecting the spirit. A "strong" manifestation will even make the spirit visible to normal people, incurring the witness effect (below). Manifesting tires the spirit significantly. (Spectrism, Cursism)  
2. **KNOWN Movement**: Spirits move at the same speeds as humans, and tire when moving at running or sprinting speeds. They can move through walls slowly. Spirits are delayed somewhat by small spaces, a keyhole equalling about 1 round of delay. Some magic can enhance speed, and some can teleport the spirit to a master but never from the master elsewhere. \*\*\*  
3. **Speakers**: Spirits find it easier to make vague sounds. When magic is involved they can form natural sounds, and sometimes speech. (Revelationism)  
4. **KNOWN Intercommunication:** Spirits can consult/inspect each other, but not as humans speak to one another but as a kind of inquiry, like looking at a leaf to see that it is green.  
5. **KNOWN Light**: Spirits are composed of light, meaning they can sometimes produce vague images. Forming into a semblance of their former self can happen, but it is difficult. Forming other things out of light is possible through magic (Illuminism).  
6. **Minds**: The mind is grounded in matter, but deeply influenced by the living spirit. Each living spirit is dedicated to an earthly mind. After death, a spirit is freed and may influence the minds of the living. (Mentalism)  
7. **KNOWN Essences**: When the spirit of a class of plants or animals is properly invoked, the properties of that plant or animal can be distilled into an essence (Naturalism).  
8. **Bonding**: A living spirit may bond (Attunism) to one or more other spirits, facilitating communication, knowledge, and even prompting action on the part of the other spirit.  
9. **Domination:** Spirits may dominate a living spirit, with the aid of magic. (Dominism\*)  
10. **Inhabiting**: A spirit can be made to inhabit a dead object built for the purpose. (Golemism\*)  
11. **Time**: Spirits experience time differently. A spirit can push another through various dimensions of time, for example to how it was yesterday, or how it's species was millions of years ago. (Degenerism\*)  
12. **Cursism**: Spirits can be made to haunt others, bringing them woe. (Cursism\*)

#### Dark Spirits {#dark-spirits}

The vast majority of spirits are not dark, but those few who have lived especially evil lives are. A regular spirit, when forced into service by a dark mage, becomes a dark spirit for the duration of its servitude. Dark mages, the spirits they control, and any entity controlled by such spirits are considered "dark aligned."

Dark aligned entities:

* **suffer 1 additional damage** from light-based attacks  
* **are hindered in sunlight** or similar bright light

#### No Undead {#no-undead}

There are no undead. Once an entity dies, its body will rot and be forever parted from the spirit. There is no force that can call a spirit back into its own body. Anything that looks dead and still has its original animating spirit never truly died, and these are exceedingly rare, for example certain mummies. Any mind so retained is likely insane from the ordeal of being in a tomb or grave for so long.

Bodies and most skeletons are too heavy for a canonically weak spirit to push around. Such motions are always clumsy, as if an invisible person were moving the limbs by hand, like a poorly controlled puppet. Even Golems have little dexterity, are never fast, etc.

#### Spirit Stats {#spirit-stats}

Level: 		1d6  
Energy:	1d6 \- how much do they want to do stuff?  
Connection:	1d6 \- how aligned with the purposes of the mage are they?  
Attitude:	Enthusiastic, Regular, Bored, Overworked, Upset, Angry  
Ethics:		Describes behaviors that will upset or anger this spirit.  
Knowledge:	One knowledge specialty

#### Attitude {#attitude}

The attitude of a spirit changes based on what you ask them to do, and what they see you do. Tethered spirits might obey with capriciousness, laziness, or sometimes petty reactions, depending on how they feel. Spirits tend to hold on to bad attitudes for days.

* **Enthusiastic** \- enjoy what the mage is asking for and will do tasks with verve.  
* **Regular** \- just do the task.  
* **Bored** \- if asked to do fewer than Energy/2 tasks a day, will get lazy & capricious  
* **Overworked** \- asked for more than their Energy tasks per day get resistant  
* **Upset\*** \- violating a spirit's ethics makes them capricious, twisting commands. Upset might never leave the spirit. Once released an upset spirit will curse the mage for a day.  
* **Angry\*** \- being asked to do something evil or cruel maximizes resistance. Anger tends to stay forever. Once released an angry spirit will curse the mage for 1d6 days
