Only those of Pure Heart and Perfect Will shall know the true kingdom of the Sublime Lord. For has he not sent the seven signs, and set the wards multi-numerous; and do the mountains not howl at the impurity of all mankind? Who shall be set apart? By what faith may those with Sight for His graces take up the Great Work? Ahlayha\! Drip the wax and grave the runes\! Look not to false prophets and weak faiths\!

Seek in your heart with the guidance of the most high, the most perfect, to know ultimate Purity. It is the True Answer from which all faiths, in their weakness, shy away. And yet so subtle are the ways of Him, most Sublime, that the very fracturing of faiths brings strife deadly to serve the Great Work.

The Great Work\!  Shuck off the impurity of mankind. Grovel, lowly dogs who see not\! Writhe, impure humanity\! Fate spits upon your foul nature\! Nothing may correct it but the Ultimate Cleansing\! There is no salvation for mankind. Ahlayha\!

Did not Cain see the truth? Was he not Sighted to slay his own brother? Did not wretched Abraham fail the True Command? And did not venerable Lot bring the righteous cleansing so well deserved? Alack, had Noah the Perfect Will to cleanse the world of himself and his kin the Great Work would now be complete. His failure is our lesson to find Perfect Will\!

Capitulate\! Let not vain hope deceive your mind\! Utterly accept the One Truth and the righteousness of the True Command. Ahlayha\! You will find it in the Empty Tomes which no man has counted. Let the beneficent green glow of Ooron reveal the subtle path to The Answer. By which Cleansing shall we know the hand of the Sublime? Seek the Tomes\! Revelation is at hand\!

We, the unworthy, may yet take up the rod and the staff to relieve the world of the poison of knowing, the filth of man's nature, and by enacting His will gain salvation\! Seek the Tomes to become Sighted\! Strive for the Perfect Will to do what must be done. Ahlayha\! Purify\! Cleanse\! Do What Must Be Done.
