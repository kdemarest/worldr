# Mr. Mump's Words

*My real name is [Sebastián de Morra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Court_dwarf). When I was a boy, growing up in the small Bavarian hamlet of Nordlingen, my father commanded the small garrison. The third in our family was my sister, June, the most beautiful and kind person I have ever known.*

*My father, being a military man, was ashamed of me for my small stature, so he sent me to the rectory on the banks of the Danube, at Ingolstadt \[birthplace of the illuminati, and the setting of Frankenstein, BTW\], sixty miles away for my letters.*

*There, I met a great man of Enlightenment who understood the world as few do. To me some hints were revealed of a threat to all living men, clothed in the allegory of Christain rhetoric, which the Enlightened resist. I became indoctrinated into this deeper understanding. I believed it was the righteous Work of all the Enlightened to strive against the dark corruption.*

*I learned to cultivate a quick mind. Being small, I had a natural talent for remaining hidden, listening, observing, and going unnoticed. Thus I learnt those certain secret arts which you have experienced in the jungles of the Gold Coast. After many years I returned home to my father, and to my beautiful sister June, rich in the hope that I might make change in the world.*

*But my life took a different course. When Cardinal-Infante Ferdinand conquered the Saxe Weimars (1643), my father sold me to the Cardinal for the sum of seven Gulden marks of fine silver. I spent many years entertaining the prince-cardinal's holy court, until he gifted me to his brother, Philip IV.*

*In Philip's court, that mightiest court of the planet, I was treated as low as the dogs, and lived only by my quick tongue and the physical japes that kept the royalty entertained.*

*It was in the court of the Planet King that I first came to understand something important. His separation from common people made him believe himself a god, above all petty concerns of humanity. Astrology was his concern, the movements of fate beyond our mortal worries. King Philip's deep love of astrology had a reason: He longed to gaze upon the Third Planet (in astrology, this is Jupiter). When once I japed about the stars, very nearly was my head estranged from my body.*

*At this time I received a visit from my dear sister June. She also knew about the struggle, and the work of the Enlightened.*

*She revealed to me that my father held the same beliefs as those great teachers at Ingolstadt. He had been ordered to deliver me to Ingolstadt, and later, he had been ordered to sell me into humiliation. At first I was angry, and I almost lost faith, but June helped me understand and set aside my selfish pride.*

*My ignorance was my defense against discovery, and the vehicle by which I entered that corrupted court. Now deeply embedded in the court of Philip, and using my powers, I obtained critical information on the King's obsession with astrology, and the machinations of the court. I sent encrypted missives by carrier pigeon to the Enlightened.*

*But I was ignorant no longer of my true purpose, and did not mask it well. I will not belabor the story of my naive mistake and eventual discovery. I fled, entering the courts of many countries to ply my trade of japes and handstands, sending insight to my respected masters in Ingolstadt. I will not lie. My humiliations in those courts left me bitter. Perhaps I spied as revenge. Perhaps I could have found some better life, yet I had a stubborn pride in the Work.*

*As a bitter and sentimental old man I returned to Lisbon, where I learned my beautiful sister had married. I sought her out, content to become the eccentric uncle to her three children. But a darkness had come over her, a bleak corruption that, in my idyllic vision of her perfection I could not, or would not, see. I was betrayed, and the agents of Philip finally caught up with me (1664). I was poisoned with a black draught, and so began a long, slow sleep of years to heal (144 years).*

*Ten years ago (1808), when the mighty and Enlightened Duke of Wellington defeated the French forces of Junot, he ended the French hope for victory in Portugal that year. Mr. Gilroy, who was part of Wellington's expedition, discovered, by signs and symbols, my sleeping place.*

*After twelve dozen years, he woke me, and inspired me. With my renewed vitality he gave me hope that I might again aid the Work. A group with the heritage of the Enlightened continued the great work, still strove to guard humanity at great peril to themselves. They had a complex role in the wars of Napoleon. Perhaps I should not tell this, but you are all proven, to me, beyond doubt. At first we clearly aided Napoleon. Later, we worked to defeat him.*

*Upon his second exile new information was somehow discovered, an opportunity to succeed where many had failed over hundreds of years. This information laid the seeds for our mission together, the outcome of which we dare to celebrate.*

*But the price of our success in the savage land has again drained my slight frame. Soon I will return to my rest. But you, my valiant companions, must meet the Enlightened in London. Do not speak a word of the true results of our mission, I charge you.*
