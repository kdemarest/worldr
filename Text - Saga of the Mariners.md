# The Saga of the Marineri: Keepers of Hidden Oceans

In the time before time, when the stars were young and the gods ponderous, the Marineri—an orca-like race of sentient beings—thrived in the grand oceans of Mars, the Blue Star of the Northern Skies, now Red and barren. Wise beyond imagination, they sang songs that could steer asteroids and weave spells that would make the waters dance.

## The Omen in the Tides

Yet, in the depths of their wisdom, they saw a shadow approaching. The Purifex, an unspeakable enemy, was devouring worlds, erasing the very fabric of life. To purify the universe was their way, until only they stood, supreme. Desperate to preserve the ancient wisdom and enchanted seas, the Marineri forged a plan both daring and dangerous.

## The Birth of Skjólstórr, the Shielded World

Deep in space they called upon their most potent runes and sang a celestial song, pulling shards from the Oort Cloud and weaving them into a sphere of steel and stone, veiling it with oceans and calling it Skjólstórr, the Shielded World, what you know as Earth. Then they entombed themselves in the core, guarding their wisdom as sentinels in a hidden fortress. Silent. Waiting.

## The Purifex's Wrath

As foreseen, the Purifex arrived. For one hundred years they drained Mars of its oceans, leaving it a barren red husk. Winding the scent of hidden life, they turned their eyes toward Earth. Their Soul Collectors, abominable entities capable of tearing spirits from living flesh, descended like dark meteors.

## The Curse of the Seven

The Soul Collectors were relentless, and one by one, the souls of the Marineri people were torn asunder. Seven Marineri champions rose to defend their hidden sanctuary, yet, they could not prevail for all their technology was fruitless. Proving forever more that mind and spirit have ascension over main force, the Purifex wove a malevolent curse, poisoning the heroes' minds, making them forget their wisdom, their rune-songs, and even their own names.

Bound by spiritual chains, these Seven were cursed to roam the oceans of Earth—now their prison—as mere shadows of their former selves, their once-celestial voices reduced to mournful cries. They became known as the Ancient Mariners, always seeking but never finding, bound forever by the tides of Skjólstórr.

## The Echo in the Waves

Having consumed their prey the Purifex left behind the Corruptor as a mighty Jovian storm with this mandate: Any who rise to wisdom shall be destroyed. With it's mind they placed all their cunning, their paranoia, their spite against all sentients not themselves. They gave it mighty artifacts with the power to harness the Seven Great Polar Storms.
