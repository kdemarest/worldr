# TOME OF FAITH

Yay the Cult of Purity shall further the will of Him most sublime, as the hammer and the chisel shape the stone, or reduce it to dust. In faith, they feel they are the hammer.

Yet, in truth, are they not a shield? As a shield shall they be, for a time comes when all with knowledge must conflict. It is destined, and those who act first act best. All delay, all parley, all suits for peace, are vain, but a tool in the hand of Him most Sublime.

Carefully they were built. Carefully were their beliefs chosen from the panoply of sentient thought, woven together. Did not the Sublime Lord study well, and understanding their frail minds, find a seductive path for feet to follow.

For the right mind, unprepared, their arms are open wide to receive the sublime lie. It is belief, faith, wholly welcomed by those vulnerable, that connects and interweaves the newly faithful in strength and unity of purpose.

Praise hatred of the other, driven by fear of the unknown, surmounted by the compulsion for purity. Purity! Worthiness! It is in their nature. Yet so easily twisted. The comforts of family drive them, yet torn down such can be remade. Made anew! Now exalted! Chosen!

Who understands the weakness of humanity? The impurity? The failures and cruelty? The yearnings? We are all saddened by what must be done, yet, only we perceive The Answer, for we are chosen. Chosen by god as the hand that weilds the hammer.

Is our family not special? Do we not have exalted purpose? True justice! A righteous cause! Only we can cleanse the impurity.
