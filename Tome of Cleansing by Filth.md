# Tome of Cleansing by Filth - Detailed

Let the deep ancients be exhumed. Set them ablaze to set the world ablaze. Ahlayha!

For are the five fingers not small, selfish, petty, mean, creatures? Ever their sight is short. Ever betraying their time-to-come when momentary desires are at stake. Ever blind beyond the bounds of their own flickering life; nay a decade; nay an hour is too long for such as these to hold back their greed for power.

Life is struggle. Life is pain. Life's only purpose: to vanquish one's enemies and hear the lamentation of their women. Only by ruthless excision may safety be achieved. There is no other, can be no other path!

How blind they are not to see this! Tyranny: the only path to victory. Every star has a limit, for never shall it burn until the utter end of time. And who shall harness the very stars? The sublime. The victor.

Did not King David wear the fiery diamond of seven starred Jupiter? At the utter end there can be only one, and mankind shall never be that one.

So pull the ancients from the sand. Pull them from the sea. Pull them from the depths of the earth. Set them ablaze in service to the five fingers, who can not resist power, and let them craft their own cleansing. Their very ruination.

Let the ancients burn and vomit their filth! By the time five fingers understands, it will be too late.  The ice warms! The very nature of the oceans changes! Extinguishing the life within. Then hunger will drive them. From the equators will they flee, unto the barren desert poles. The blaze will pursue them.

Then shall they know the subtlety of the Lord Most Sublime. Then shall their folly be made clear, at the utter most end. They will expire in hopelessness and futility, raging at the weakness of their own foolish nature.
