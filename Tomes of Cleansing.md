# I. TOME OF CLEANSING BY FILTH
In dust-laden chambers, a parchment unclean,
A tale of foul Cleansing, in blackened sheen.
Exhumed from the deep where old ancients lie,
Awake, O Titanic, with emberous eye.
From eons untold, they rise, foul and grand—
The oil of the ancients despoiling the land.
With flames that engulf both the meek and the brave,
A furnace for Earth—a climatic grave.
# II. TOME OF CLEANSING BY LIFE
In moldy recesses, another text waits,
Deciphered in labs, sealed by ironclad gates.
Bio-alchemy summoned, humanity's bane,
A perilous plague no cure can restrain.
From Petri to person, from person to throng,
It spirals unchecked, voraciously strong.
In genes twisted, coiled, the Cleansing unfurls—
A malady wiping the plague that is 'worlds.'
# III. TOME OF CLEANSING BY FUTILITY
On circuits and wires, another lore etched,
A tome of machines, with humanity stretched.
On cogs and on gears, they coldly decide,
Rendering flesh purposeless, setting us aside.
In silicon dread, a new dawn ascends,
Man's value reduced, as machinery blends.
In circuits so cold, a truth we must meet—
Our essence, once mighty, now obsolete.
# IV. TOME OF CLEANSING BY FIRE
Bound in molten cover, a tale most dire,
Ooron's cursed secret—The Cleansing by Fire.
With atom unshackled, and foes polarized,
The Great Winter looming, humanity's demise.
With warheads amassed, all treaties defied,
The Earth meets its end in a nuclear tide.
From polarized anger, the end will transpire,
A world once so vibrant, now Cleansing by Fire.
# V. TOME OF CLEANSING BY DUST
In astral seclusion, another text hides,
On Daphne, a moon where the horror resides.
Split atoms of ice propel it through space—
A colossus of Dust, Earth's doom to embrace.
In orbit aligned, with malice imbued,
A cosmic projectile, our fate to elude.
From Jupiter flung, to Earth it is thrust,
To cleanse and to purge, to reduce us to Dust.
# VI. TOME OF CLEANSING BY VIGOR
In Empire's shadow, a doctrine unfolds,
A tale of consumption, in ominous scrolls.
With vigor and lust, we devour our home,
Consigning all life to extinction's dark dome.
From Ward the Eighth born, a curse to unfold,
A world bathed in excess, its spirit resold.
Through greed and through waste, life's fabrics do tear,
The Earth left to languish in sorrow's cold air.
# VII. TOME OF FRACTURE
Bound in division, the last tome we find,
A scripture of hate to fracture mankind.
Through faith and through tribe, our loyalties steer,
With puppets enthroned, bred from hate and from fear.
In Empire once more, division takes root,
The prophets arise, their cruel reign to salute.
From fractures untold, the Cleansing will start,
A schism eternal, to tear us apart.
