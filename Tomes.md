# TOMES

Tomes only exist because the C is proud of his subtlety. He feels his victory is the greater if he fully reveals his plans, confident that sentients are too stupid to see, too short-lived to stop him, and too selfish to avoid their end.

There are two types:  
\- apocalyptic tomes describe one of the apocalypses that will end how manity  
\- tool tomes reveal methods, like fracture and the cult of Purity.

## I TOME OF CLEANSING BY FILTH

See the actual, full tome.

From the Kumasi palace library, on a pedestal.

Outlines global warming as a path to eradicate humanity. By digging up the liquid bodies of the deep ancients (dinosaurs) and setting them ablaze to produce Filth. To set the world afire. In sanskrit the date is 1859\. Which requires technology that uses the liquid. This results in the Apocalypse of Filth.


## (II) TOME OF CLEANSING BY LIFE  
Pandemic that wipes out all human life. Possibly natural due to mega-population, but nore likely to be a biotechnology & genetically modified organism pandemic that gets out of control.

## (III) TOME OF CLEANSING BY FUTILITY

Machinery/AI rendering humans purposeless

## (IV) TOME OF CLEANSING BY FIRE

Outlines mining ooron to give humanity the atom bomb. Then the Tome of Fracture does the rest. This results in the Apocalypse of Fire.

## (V) TOME OF CLEANSING BY DUST

Tells of the "long work" of finding and then redirecting Daphne, a 12 mile wide former moon of Jupiter. The interior is ice. By splitting the hydrogen from the oxygen, an ad-hoc thruster was created that is moving it into slingshot orbits that will eventually reach earth.

## (VI) TOME OF CLEANSING BY VIGOR

Overpopulation driving consumption, commons abuse, and ecological collapse

## TOME OF FRACTURE

Outlines how to fracture mankind with faith, with tribalism, and the necessity of exalting leaders who derive power from division using the Great Tools hate and fear. Exalt his puppets the prophets. Let none see beyond family, beyond tribe. It describes the British Empire as an abomination 

## TOME OF FAITH

See the details Tome fo Faith.

GM Only:

Explicitly describes how the creation of the Cult of Purity was astroturfed as living tools to further the will of the Lord most Sublime. And his will is extinction to secure himself from encroachment by humanity.

Describes how the religious principles harmonize with what the C has learned of human nature, combined with the Wards, to make belief in the necessity of extinction of humanity palatable.

Alludes the inevitable deep future in which sentients must conflict for supremacy, so the only course is to gain victory now through extinction. All sentients have a central mind which, should it become aware of the C, will attack. So the C only wars in secret.
