## !Eighth Ward

# !Avatars
The corruptor has multiple avatars that mirror his aspects. When each possesses a person there is a different effect.

The avatars are: An Egyptian, Minoan, Chinese (Wucheng), Persian, Indian, Bantu, Olmec, and soon the 8th will be British

1. Submission (the word Islam means Submission), including misplaced loyalty  
2. Falsehood/deception, including making up false reasons for things to satisfy emotion  
3. Ignorance/faith/reality warping - in the sense of never seeking truth when emotion is satisfied; includes a lack of self-knowledge, and a lack of curiosity and no feeling of needing to know reality  
4. Subjugation - Bantu, 4th ward, The Enslavement of both of men and nature, without regard to balance  
5. Hate/disregard/callousness - This avatar is the entry point to most access by the Corruptor into the minds of humans  
6. Misplaced loyalty - only following those who meet your emotional criteria, rather than looking beyond to the good of the whole  
7. TBD
