# **\!Overview** {#!overview}

**Magic is based on spirits**, typically of the dead. In game terms, a person has both a "soul" which is unknowable, and a "spirit" which exists ethereally within the world. Sentients, animals and plants have markedly different spirits. Specifically, species of plants and very dumb animals typically have one "master soul" per species that is shared among them all, but each still has an individual spirit.

**Magic does not directly damage health**, except to the degree that a small child could do so. That is generally limited to 1 point. Magic can, however, hinder things like edge.

**Magic is mysterious and unpredictable**. Like human nature, magic can never be entirely predicted. It remains mysterious, hidden, inscrutable. If a character's magic is reliably having the exact same effect over and over something needs to change.

# **\!Spirits** {#!spirits}

The spirits of men and beasts are mysterious. In time they shed the husk of their mortal coil, vanishing to an unknown destiny, or remaining to haunt the living. Their impact upon the material world is tenuous, until harnessed by a mage for evil or good.

## **Ether** {#ether}

Ether (aka spirit ether) permeates the space around matter. Spirits are concentrated ether catalyzed by existence.

Ether can be woven into Strands, which can be:

* Spirit cloaks and spirit armor  
* Bonds to bind two spirits together in an abomination, like sewing a man and a beast  
* Woven with matter via runes, to create containing structures, portal wormholes, and gravity envelopes.

## **Spirits** {#spirits}

The material form of an entity is called the "husk", which the spirit occupies. Spirits may never be created except by nature. Nearing death makes the spirit visible as it dissociates from the husk. Material death frees the sentient spirit, which slowly rises and (probably) dissolves into ether.

### **Spirit Types** {#spirit-types}

* Sentient \- Sentience coalesces ether into spirit, tethered by nature to the husk that carries the mind until death frees the spirit  
* Notable Living Things \- A specific living thing of significance, eg the spirit of the eldest oak, which is an extension of the spirit of its class but acts independently.  
* Beast \- Species with volition coalesce ether into Animal Spirits, one for each type of animal, connected to their ecosystems. Eg the spirit of foxes, or of horses.  
* Living Things \- Also grouped by type, like the spirit of oak trees.  
* Nature \- The spirit of the wind, or rain or thunder.

### **Haunting** {#haunting}

Spirits are to be found in the world primarily due to hauntings, that is, upon death spirits spontaneously bind to a place, object, or entity due to strong emotion, will power, extreme trauma, karmic injustice, or an unresolved critical task.

### **Connecting** {#connecting}

Through magery an entity can connect to one or more spirits, or manipulate such spirits, as follows:

* Tether \- Be tethered willingly by a light Spirit Master  
* Shackle \- Be shackled unwillingly by a dark Spirit Master, bent to the master's will.  
* Bind \- Be bound to a golem body via blue crystal (dark)  
* Confine \- Be contained within a runed pentahedron or vessel  
* Meld \- Be combined with another spirit in an abomination, typically by a Spirit Changer.  
* Stitch \- A left-over bit of spirit can be stitched to an object, like a shield or figurine. Bound spirits can then be used in magic, as described in the book Spirit Magic

## Spirit Cloaking {#spirit-cloaking}

I'm thinking that somebody, maybe St B, some illuminati, and a priest of Djoser, have been working to enable spirit cloaking. Gahan's savantism, Lucius decryption, and Henton s spirit mastery combine to solve the final puzzles and eventually produce spirit cloaks.

Trips to Jupiter first in the Zocto suit, but eventually the true path is to "clothe yourself in spirit armor". Aka spirit cloaking.

Spirit cloaks can be leveled with experience, to avoid the gaze of soul collectors, to repel the diamond rain, against specific wards perhaps, gain control of automatons or inhabit/drive them as vehicles, survive vacuum and cold.

Just as the sphere frame has parts that are between the spirit world and material world, so go the spirit cloaks. Only Reality Discipline or Seeing the Unseen can reveal them. In the material world you'll be apparently walking on Jupiter with no special gear.

## **Spirits Rules** {#spirits-rules}

Some spirits are **active** (requiring easier difficulty from 1 to 3 to sense), but most are Dormant, meaning that they are (generally roll 8\) not visible and not accessible to a mage. A spirit that is active can be spoken with and potentially tethered.

No magic exists without some component of spirit or ether driving it, and ether magic is never "active".

### **Spirit Characteristics** {#spirit-characteristics}

The souls of the dead struggle to pierce the veil of the living, creating the following general characteristics. Some magic abilities break these guidelines:

1. **Formless:** Spirits don't interact with matter, in general. They have no form, for example they are not 'human shaped'. They are non-local, that is, there is no particular "point in space" that a spirit occupies. Matter may not touch spirits.  
2. **Detectable:** Most sentients can not perceive spirits unless the spirit is "strongly manifest". However, a mage with Sense Spirit can, to the extent described in that ability. Most spirits are deeply Dormant (roll 8), but a few, for whatever reason, are more easily sensible. See Sense Spirit for details. (Sense Spirit)  
3. **KNOWN Listeners:** Spirits may listen to you, or not, but they are constrained by language similar to any entity. They can perceive motions, for example pantomime. It is possible to communicate with some spirits with telepathy.   
4. **Tethering**: Spirits may be coaxed into service (Tethering). Once serving, they are utterly bound to do their master's will, but they can do it lazily, inaccurately, or poorly. They can depart at the next full moon.  
5. **Enslavement**: Spirits can be forced by an evil act into servitude. Unlike tethering, enslavement doesn't require the spirit to agree. See below.  
6. **Resisting:** Entities of matter may resist the effects of spirits (by their tier).  
7. **KNOWN Blocking**: Spirit motion is blocked by "dense elements", which are thin gold or thick lead. Helmets help resist, but only utterly surrounding a mind (and thus the rest of the body) can completely exclude spirits. A hole the size of a lock will slow spirit one round. The seam in a poorly fit coffin will slow it two rounds. See "substances".  
8. **Attracting**: Spirits yearn for sulphur (per Paracelsus), and can be distracted by it. See "substances".  
9. **Types**: Animal and plant spirits are different than sentient spirits.  
10. **Undeath**: The spirits of the dead never return to life. It is a one way journey.

### **Spirit General Abilities** {#spirit-general-abilities}

1. **Manifesting**: Spirits may temporarily manifest, making them able to push or touch matter. The reverse is not true \- matter may not touch the spirit. Many effects require the spirit to slightly manifest, giving an asset to detecting the spirit. A "strong" manifestation will even make the spirit visible to normal people, incurring the witness effect (below). Manifesting tires the spirit significantly. (Spectrism, Cursism)  
2. **KNOWN Movement**: Spirits move at the same speeds as humans, and tire when moving at running or sprinting speeds. They can move through walls slowly. Spirits are delayed somewhat by small spaces, a keyhole equalling about 1 round of delay. Some magic can enhance speed, and some can teleport the spirit to a master but never from the master elsewhere. \*\*\*  
3. **Speakers**: Spirits find it easier to make vague sounds. When magic is involved they can form natural sounds, and sometimes speech. (Revelationism)  
4. **KNOWN Intercommunication:** Spirits can consult/inspect each other, but not as humans speak to one another but as a kind of inquiry, like looking at a leaf to see that it is green.  
5. **KNOWN Light**: Spirits are composed of light, meaning they can sometimes produce vague images. Forming into a semblance of their former self can happen, but it is difficult. Forming other things out of light is possible through magic (Illuminism).  
6. **Minds**: The mind is grounded in matter, but deeply influenced by the living spirit. Each living spirit is dedicated to an earthly mind. After death, a spirit is freed and may influence the minds of the living. (Mentalism)  
7. **KNOWN Essences**: When the spirit of a class of plants or animals is properly invoked, the properties of that plant or animal can be distilled into an essence (Naturalism).  
8. **Bonding**: A living spirit may bond (Attunism) to one or more other spirits, facilitating communication, knowledge, and even prompting action on the part of the other spirit.  
9. **Domination:** Spirits may dominate a living spirit, with the aid of magic. (Dominism\*)  
10. **Inhabiting**: A spirit can be made to inhabit a dead object built for the purpose. (Golemism\*)  
11. **Time**: Spirits experience time differently. A spirit can push another through various dimensions of time, for example to how it was yesterday, or how it's species was millions of years ago. (Degenerism\*)  
12. **Cursism**: Spirits can be made to haunt others, bringing them woe. (Cursism\*)

#### Dark Spirits {#dark-spirits}

The vast majority of spirits are not dark, but those few who have lived especially evil lives are. A regular spirit, when forced into service by a dark mage, becomes a dark spirit for the duration of its servitude. Dark mages, the spirits they control, and any entity controlled by such spirits are considered "dark aligned."

Dark aligned entities:

* **suffer 1 additional damage** from light-based attacks  
* **are hindered in sunlight** or similar bright light

#### No Undead {#no-undead}

There are no undead. Once an entity dies, its body will rot and be forever parted from the spirit. There is no force that can call a spirit back into its own body. Anything that looks dead and still has its original animating spirit never truly died, and these are exceedingly rare, for example certain mummies. Any mind so retained is likely insane from the ordeal of being in a tomb or grave for so long.

Bodies and most skeletons are too heavy for a canonically weak spirit to push around. Such motions are always clumsy, as if an invisible person were moving the limbs by hand, like a poorly controlled puppet. Even Golems have little dexterity, are never fast, etc.

#### Spirit Stats {#spirit-stats}

Level: 		1d6  
Energy:	1d6 \- how much do they want to do stuff?  
Connection:	1d6 \- how aligned with the purposes of the mage are they?  
Attitude:	Enthusiastic, Regular, Bored, Overworked, Upset, Angry  
Ethics:		Describes behaviors that will upset or anger this spirit.  
Knowledge:	One knowledge specialty

#### Attitude {#attitude}

The attitude of a spirit changes based on what you ask them to do, and what they see you do. Tethered spirits might obey with capriciousness, laziness, or sometimes petty reactions, depending on how they feel. Spirits tend to hold on to bad attitudes for days.

* **Enthusiastic** \- enjoy what the mage is asking for and will do tasks with verve.  
* **Regular** \- just do the task.  
* **Bored** \- if asked to do fewer than Energy/2 tasks a day, will get lazy & capricious  
* **Overworked** \- asked for more than their Energy tasks per day get resistant  
* **Upset\*** \- violating a spirit's ethics makes them capricious, twisting commands. Upset might never leave the spirit. Once released an upset spirit will curse the mage for a day.  
* **Angry\*** \- being asked to do something evil or cruel maximizes resistance. Anger tends to stay forever. Once released an angry spirit will curse the mage for 1d6 days

# **\!Perilous Knowledge** {#!perilous-knowledge}

Sharing secret knowledge about magic, the Corruptor, or anything occult that might enable action against the Corruptor puts the sharer at risk. Also, the learner is at similar risks when acquiring knowledge of the spirits through whatever means.

Such a malefaction can come in different forms:

* Chaos \- every action roll vs Chaos Resistance or suffer a mischance. Such things most often hinder the victim, but sometimes they inflict damage.

* Cursing \- local spirits might spontaneously curse the victim. See curses for details.

* Madness \- 

# **\!Magery** {#!magery}

Magery is a Tier 1 ability that a character may take when the GM allows. When a character becomes a mage, they gain:

* Ability:		Sense Spirit  
* Ability:		Connect Spirit  
* Skill:		One Magic Type (see below)

When a mage causes a spirit to take an action, it does so at the tier of the mage, and using any Effort the mage might choose to deploy.

### **Ability: Sense Spirit** {#ability:-sense-spirit}

You passively sense untethered co-aligned spirits and spirits you have tethered. A spirit is often a kind of glow, or smell or taste. Dark spirits (including shackled spirits), are like an inky fog, black, with tendrils like ink.

Opposing Spirits: To see opposing spirits spend i1 to sense them for one minute (10 rounds)

Cloaked Spirits: If a mage has cloaked their spirits you must spend i1 and roll vs their tier to penetrate the cloak for one minute. You may retry the roll each round until you succeed.

### **Ability: Connect Spirit** {#ability:-connect-spirit}

Since all magic is mediated by spirits, a mage must somehow connect to one or more spirits to make magical effects. Light mages do this with the willing consent of the spirit(s), and likewise collaborate when requesting the spirit to perform tasks. Dark mages force a connection, and tyrannically order their spirits to act.

Due to this difference, light mages retain their spirits more easily, while dark mages can shackle more spirits but lose them more easily.

* A light mage may tether up to \<tier\> spirits, and keep that same number Active.  
* A dark mage may shackle up to 3x\<tier\> spirits and keep that same number Active.  
* Additional spirits may be brought into Hedrons and the like, but doing so does not assume a connection.  
* Spirits act at the tier of their mage. Effort by the mage channels through the spirit.

A connected spirit will:

* Produce magic as directed by the mage (see Magic Types below)  
* Travel with the mage, in a way the player may specify, but never in a manifest form.  
* Depart, each full moon**,** if the mage fails a new Tether roll

### **\!Tethering** {#!tethering}

Light Mages connect to spirits by a voluntary process called Tethering. Most spirits are reluctant if not outright hostile to the idea of tethering, because once tethered they are strongly compelled to do as ordered and may not attempt to depart until the next full moon.

A mage may tether up to their tier in spirits, as follows.

1. Find \- One must first find a spirit that is detectable. The GM will let you know if you find such spirits.  
2. Communicate \- You must speak with and convince a spirit to be bound, thus you must know its language or have some means of communication. Skill with the spirit's historical time period, region, social class or political faction can provide an asset.  
3. Serve \- Many spirits require a small (or large\!) act of charity, vengeance, etc from the mage, at the GM's discretion, and tethering might not be complete until such is done.  
4. Connect \- Spend 1 int and 1 minute to tether. Remember Witness Effect might apply. **Roll 6 \+ spiritTier \- mageTier** to tether

When a **spirit agrees**, you tether it (allocate 1 Int for as long as you have the spirit) and it is bound until you release it or a full moon arrives and it rebels.

### **\!Shackling** {#!shackling}

Any mages can choose to force the connection to a spirit. This scars the mage's soul with darkness. Sark mages often murder to obtain a specific spirit, and mystical preparations before a murder can yield a more powerful but more temporary spirit shackle.

## **Research** {#research}

Discovery comes in these tranches

1. Learn of the "Seven Secrets" (steps 2 and 3 below)  
2. Formless, Detectable, Listeners  
3. Tethering and Enslavement, Resisting, Blocking  
4. One Ability or Reagent or Writing. NOTE that learning the Dark Arts should happen through gameplay, and only after experiencing them for a while are the principles discovered.

### Lucius' Briefing {#lucius'-briefing}

Secret writings  
Two layers of Benedictines  
Deeper mission of the Benedictine order  
A scroll and a keybook to interpret the secret writings of Saint Benedict  
Research and learn to unlock various truths  
\[kd\] possible collision of Benedictine work and witch-like magic

### **Effects** {#effects}

1. **KNOWN** Witness Effect  
2. Circumstances  
3. Tethering abilities  
4. Communication brings woe: check the stars, the moon, the seasons, and the circumstances to ease the risk.

## **Writing** {#writing}

[Reference for Alchemical Symbols](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alchemical_Symbols_\(Unicode_block\))

Magic can be described in any language, but the special runes that express magic have unusual aspects:

1. Slippery: The shapes of the runes can not be held in the human consciousness. One may view them, but they squirm in the mind. Attempting to reproduce them invariably leads to a different shape. Comparing one shape to the next, however, will appear correct for most. Taking photos always improperly reproduces them, yet they always seem correct.  
2. Chronastrolib: The meaning of the shapes shifts according to the positions of astral bodies. The simplest ones are keyed to the sun. The more complex ones depend on the planets, constellations, and sometimes more subtle bodies like moons or comets.  
3. Ink Components  
4. Proper writing instruments  
5. Gibberish: Books are always written with much gibberish and obfuscation, because if the spirits (eg the corruptor) learns that it is disclosing magical truth the book will inevitably be destroyed in an "accident". The burning of the Library of Alexandria? Well, they had kept books of magical truths safe for hundreds of years, but when they were discovered...

## **\!Witness Effect** {#!witness-effect}

The Witness Effect makes magic perceived by others more difficult to complete. If there are multiple witnesses choose the worst single penalty applicable from the table below. Anyone who knows that magic is real is not a witness. The Difficulty adjusts as follows:

Penalty	Perception  
1h		Witness *suspects or is certain* magic is being done  
2h		Witness will see *unlikely* results  
3h		Witness will see *impossible* results

If the mage does not perceive a certain witness, the initial pool points are still spent. At that moment the effect of the unexpected witness will be felt (but not the location of the witness) and additional Effort may be chosen to overcome the Witness Effect.

If the **result** of the magic is only apparent many minutes or hours later, or the result is not detectable by the witness, then the result should not be considered, subject to GM discretion and interpretation. For example, some big magical effects might happen very quietly. That is, when a ship quietly enters a fog and comes out halfway across the world, there was no Witness at the time of casting.

## **\!Circumstances** {#!circumstances}

Extremely powerful mages or relics naturally amplify the nature of magic and loosen the bonds of physical law around them, with the following effects:

Magnification		\- Magic becomes more dramatic, overpowered, and uncontrolled.  
Loosening		\- Physical laws are impaired, making magic that violates them easier.  
Empowerment		\- Edge is granted to all nearby in Int, Might or Speed  
Infusion		\- Free floating Int pool exists, consumable by anyone with a roll

## **General Mage Abilities** {#general-mage-abilities}

**T1 Spirit Defense (e)** \- You are Trained when defending against any spirit you can sense. This can be taken a second time.

**T1 Trusted Medium (i1)** \- You gain an asset communicating with a chosen spirit. Enabler.

**T2 Spirit Hunter** (e) \- Trained in all skills finding, tracking and sensing spirits. Once per day may coax a dormant spirit awake for communication.

**T2 Read Spirit** (i2) \- For one minute you may discern a spirit's stats and purpose. Action.

**T3 Spirit Passive Defense (e)** \- You are Trained when defending against any spirit, whether you can sense the spirit or not.

**T4 Sensor (i4)** \- A spirit is the sensor

**T5 Call Dead Spirit** \- Per CSR, except the spirit conforms to this guide's limitations.

# **Spiritual Defenses** {#spiritual-defenses}

After sufficient experience with the ways of spirits, one can begin to acquire spiritual defenses to resist certain effects. These are listed below.

Entities who callously cause harm to life are more vulnerable to spiritual attack, by 1 or 2 hindrances. This follows the same theme as what brought the Corruptor into the world in the first place. When such hindrances accumulate the target "feels a door open", that is, the metaphorical door to the dark side of their own spirit.

## **Curatives** {#curatives}

Coins imbued with the good of a mage are the most common curative against magical effects. For example, a coin under the tongue will speed recovery from cursed blindness. It will ease the roll of an exorcist to eject a spirit from one possessed.

## **Defenses** {#defenses}

You must now buy a 5th thing, one of these, each tier. You can also spend your level skill to increase one of these by one level. First buy is Practiced, second is Trained, and third is Specialized.

#### Intention Shield \[IS\] {#intention-shield-[is]}

Skill granting 0, 1 or 2 on defense rolls when a spirit is watching your thoughts.

Resists mind reading, including anticipating the target's next move, being detected because of your mind, etc. 

#### Reality Discipline \[RD\] {#reality-discipline-[rd]}

Skill granting 0, 1 or 2 on rolls to perceive reality altered by spirits.

Using Reality Discipline to pierce the illusions of altered reality is line using a flashlight in a pitch black basement room. You only see what you explicitly tell the GM that you focus on.

You can focus on one thing per round, or spend **1 int** to persist the effect you for one minute (10 rounds). Once an altered reality is properly perceived you no longer have to roll, unless a mage alters reality again. You do perceive a ghostly image of what fooled people are seeing/experiencing.

#### Body Autonomy \[BA\] {#body-autonomy-[ba]}

Skill granting 0, 1 or 2 on defense rolls vs curses on your body.

You resist spirit tampering with the normal function of your body such as blindness, deafness, lock jaw, numb hands and the like.

#### Liberated Mind \[LM\] {#liberated-mind-[lm]}

Skill granting 0, 1 or 2 on defense rolls against possession or mental invasion.

You resist possession of your mind by a spirit (enabling it to alter your actions or take you over entirely) as well as mental invasion (sinister whispers, mind-dwelling spies, etc). Eg the Grumbler's invasion of Constance's mind

#### Chaos Resistance \[CR\] {#chaos-resistance-[cr]}

Skill granting 0, 1, or 2 on defense rolls vs. misfortune caused by spirits.

Helps dampen the bad luck effects of the sharing forbidden or secret knowledge.

### **Sample Spirit Powers** {#sample-spirit-powers}

\- **Prediction** \- the warrior knows what you are going to do, and acts preemptively to foil it.  
vs: Intention Shield

\- **Mind Detection** \- all sneaking, hiding and ambush are foiled. Your location is known.  
vs. Intention Shield

\- **Curses** \- based on what the curse is.  
vs Body Autonomy for things like blindness, tripping, lock jaw, numb hands etc.  
vs Intention Shield for things like tourettes

\- **Illusion** \- resist seeing what is not there, or seeing through to the reality below. This isn't a  
vs Reality Discipline

\- **Non-Perception** \- This is what Grimaldi is using to make memories of him as Barto not exist for most people, and to forestall Bolton's memories to the next day.  
vs Reality Discipline

\- **Redirection** \- a mental reconstruction of reality makes your actions target an ally instead of an enemy  
vs Reality Discipline

\- False Hunger \- inflicting hunger makes the victim eat constantly, distending their belly. They lose their Speed effort one per day. The hunger is also distracting. If food is visible, they will be distracted by it.  
vs: Body Autonomy, Sensorium Control

\- Hopeless \- believing nothing is possible prompts the target to fail to take action, or trying lackadaisically because what is the point anyway? Prevents you from spending Effort on anything.  
vs. Liberated Mind

\- Grim Chance \- Whatever can go wrong will tend to go wrong, resulting in accidents that injure or socially harm the target(s). Grim Chance can not be resisted when it is the result of disclosing magical information.  
vs. Chaos Resistance

# **\!Schools of Magic** {#!schools-of-magic}

A mage must take proficiency in a magic type, as follows:

1. [Attunism](#bookmark=id.e7wudfmwclrj)	\- connect with another's spirit  
2. [Companionism](#bookmark=id.ty3irlazc9x5) \- use spirits for knowledge and defense  
3. [Cursism](#bookmark=id.xx368t5ciwsm)\*	\- use spirits to inflict a curse upon a victim  
4. [Degenerism](#bookmark=id.ieuuhhkpfdga)\*	\- alter things to a state earlier in time  
5. Originist \- Biggles' nascent pseudo-science.  
6. [Dominism](#bookmark=id.8jh95ijnpkjs)\*	\- overthrowing a living spirit to occupy their mortal coil  
7. [Golemism](#bookmark=id.eulvu8j67d05)\*	\- use a spirit to animate a golem  
8. [Illuminism](#bookmark=id.lkt37nv9boma)	\- wield spirits as manifestations of pure light  
9. [Mentalism](#bookmark=id.nfmkw58hbzs)	\- tap a living spirit to influence their choices  
10. [Naturalism](#bookmark=id.ntif4ow5u92g)	\- invoke plant and animal essences to change physiology  
11. [Realitism](#bookmark=id.m0rpw9sgati7)\*	\- twist reality to your will  
12. [Revelationism](#bookmark=id.vebp1egx0dn2)	\- use spirits to sense and reveal  
13. [Spectrism](#bookmark=id.qy0j0o5rp0zs)	\- make a spirit take action in the material world  
14. Witching	\- magic reserved for witches only

## **\!Attunism** {#!attunism}

Spirits: co-aligned

Creates a **long-term bond** by tethering the **spirit of an item** with which you have close confederacy. Attunism can also be used within your **lair**, giving special capabilities there. For example, a Captain might always know when his ship is damaged, a Navigator if his sextant was touched. A soldier might hear from his dagger where to stab an enemy.

Casting:  
The item must be special to the mage. After taking Attunism as a school the mage gets one attuned item. Each additional attunement costs 1/3/5/7/9 Int allocation.

Abilities:

* **T1 Spirit Bond (e)** \- You bond with the spirit of an object or place, and get basic information about it: whether it still exists, is damaged, is repaired, and the general direction to the spirit. Bonding requires 24 hours.  
* **T2 Buddy Spirit (i3)** \- You temporarily attune to the spirit of a willing person, gaining knowledge about them similar to the spirit bonds above. This is a light-weight bond which other bonding magic can not leverage.  
* **T2 Spirit Bond \- Knowledge (e)** \- A previous spirit bond now allows you to sense the nature of whomever is touching the item. If you touch the bonded spirit, you learn who might have been interacting with the object.  
* **T3 Spirit Bond \- Service (e)** \- You may ask a bonded spirit to do things, like a ship sailing, house opening doors, or a ring slipping from a finger. Opposing a creature or sentient requires a successful attack roll.  
* **T3 Spirit Bond \- Call (i3)** \- Call a human-carryable bonded spirit's object to your hand within Long range. The object must move through space as the manifest spirit pushes it, it does not teleport. If held by another you must make a successful attack.  
* **T4 Spirit Bond \- Viewing (i4)** \- You can see through a bonded spirit's eyes, improving your ability to ask it to do things. Range is short and duration is 1 minute. Each additional int spent improves range or duration.  
* **T4 Spirit Bond \- Kinesis (i2)** \- You may cause a bonded spirit's object of 15lbs or less to fly through the air as you direct for one minute.  
* **T5 Bonded Converse (e)** \- When within vocal range you may converse with your bonded spirit at will.

## **\!Companionism** {#!companionism}

A companionist is a light mage (also called a medium) who befriends spirits. They have the easiest time tethering, and often take spirit telepathy to overcome language barriers.

### **Spirit Qualities** {#spirit-qualities}

The important qualities of a spirit, for companionist purposes, include

* The spirit's tier. For spirits this is also how many metaphorical hits they can take.  
* Language  
* Key life experiences  
* Key knowledge acquired during life  
* Key skill set due to former profession or background

### **Spirit Opposition** {#spirit-opposition}

When a companionist mage confronts a spirit, some possible outcomes (in order of power) include:

1. **Abate**		the spirit stops its function for one round, but it resumes the next  
2. **Abjure**		the spirit loses grasp and return to its mage  
3. **Vanquish**	the spirit halts activity and becomes inactive to the mage  
4. **Liberate**	the spirit is unshackled  
5. **Convert**	the spirit unshackles and becomes tethered

### **Abilities** {#abilities}

A companionist mage can acquire abilities such as the following. For Watch, Guard, and Resist only a single spirit can be assigned to a single target (including the mage) at a time.

**Observe** \- relay perceptions of the material world, from any distance. The spirit must travel to the destination first. It may also wait and act as an alarm. Spirit perceptions are filtered through how spirits see the world.

**Share Knowledge** \- the mage may ask the spirit for knowledge it possessed while it was alive. Roll DC depends on the importance and obscurity of the knowledge.

**Share Skill** \- the mage may channel a key skill possessed by the spirit while it was alive, typically granting an asset or, sometimes as a special effect, temporarily acquiring the skill.

**Watch** \- A spirit watches over a target, conveying what they perceive to the mage. Roll to detect incoming curses, degenerism, or attempts at possession. The spirit might granting the target a bonus according to the spirit's key life experiences.

**Guard** \- A guard spirit defends a victim against possession by a dark spirit. Roll Liberated Mind each round. If the roll fails the mage may choose: either the victim is now possessed (requiring exorcism), or the spirit may suffer 1 hit. A special effect may abjure or vanquish the spirit.

**Resist** \- engage a spirit to abate a curse or stall degeneration. Roll each round. Success abates the curse that round.  A special effect may abjure or vanquish the spirit. Or give a \+2 to whomever they are guarding.

**Redirect** \- free floating spirits may be directed into a Hedron. Roll vs the tier of any opposition attempting to direct the spirits elsewhere, adjusted by the friendliness of the spirits.

**Vanquish** \- the mage may take an action in concert with a spirit that is Watching, Guarding or Resisting to Vanquish the opposing spirit. Spend an int then roll vs tier. Gain up to two assets for each \+1 int spent.

**Liberate** \- the mage may take an action in concert with a spirit that is Watching, Guarding or Resisting to Vanquish the opposing spirit. Spend an int then roll vs tier. Gain up to two assets for each \+1 int spent. Failure causes the mage int damage equal to the tier of the spirit being liberated.

Thoughts on Henton's Spirits

**Felix:** \+1 to Liberate a shackled spirit. He aids persuasion and empathy because he knows what it is to be a slave. He can communicate with other spirits.

**Bean**: \+1 to Guard a target. He trained for seventeen years to combat subjugation by the 5th Ward, so this is familiar territory for him.

**Zira**: \+1 to assist Liberated Mind on a Watched target, because of her rigorous scientific mental discipline. She will also know when the target

## **\!Cursism\*** {#!cursism*}

Souls: Dark only

Force a spirit to plague the living, or haunt a location.

Curses can be inflicted by overthrown people, dark mages, dark creatures, objects or locations. A shackled spirit is used to enact the curse. Victims must have the curse removed, or in the case of objects or locations the spirit must be untethered from it. Cursed objects sometimes mend themselves, or magically appear back on your person. (some handy [Curse Source Material](http://dndspeak.com/curses-conditions/))

NOTES: Curses often activate when you roll a 1\. One curse widens your critical fail range

Casting: Creating a curse requires rolling an attack, then binding 1 point of your Int pool to the curse, until removal. The curse is an order to a spirit of generally no more than one to three words.

Removing: A curse is ongoing until the mage declares it halted, or the curse is removed. If the spirit is malicious it might stay, so even the caster might need Effort to remove their own curse. Death of the mage halts the curse. Learning and using the spirit's name Eases the difficulty.

Effects: See Spectrism for details.

## **\!Degenerism\*** {#!degenerism*}

The mage regresses entities back to a prototype of their evolution, growth, or construction. This school also encapsulates the twisting of sentients into a mix with another (animal) species. For example:

* Revert a man to an ape  
* Mix men and bats to create awful demon-like creatures  
* Blend me with birds. Such things are always morose, pathetic, and disease-ridden  
* Cause a candle to be restored (unburned)  
* Change a sword into the ore it was made from  
* Change woven cotton to cotton blooms  
* Change a satiated person back to hungry

## **\!Dominism\*** {#!dominism*}

vs Liberated Mind

The mage projects an enslaved spirit, or their own spirit, into the mortal coil of another, achieving various objectives. The target typically feels like "something is pushing against their mind, trying to enter it."

Those without magical defenses get no roll and are simply overcome with the appropriate effect. Magical defenses give the opportunity to resist as described below.

### **Dwelling** {#dwelling}

Inserts a spy spirit into a target's mind. The spirit can perceive everything the victim perceives, though relaying such information is not automatic. A sufficiently skilled Dwelling attack goes unnoticed if the resistance roll fails.

### **Invasion** {#invasion}

vs LM to throw off the invader  
A form of quick mental intrusion in which a spirit enters the mind of and possesses a target, enabling Control as detailed below. Requires a single round, instant attack.

After invasion a victim with Liberated Mind may roll every turn to throw off the invader. Victims without Liberated Mind will stay invaded at the attacker's whim.

### **Grumbling** {#grumbling}

A so-called grumbler can plague a victim with distractions of noise and voices. This creates hindrance 1 due to sleeplessness and distraction. You will doubt your sanity, your friends, eventually construing their every action in the worst light. It can lead towards Possession.

Immediately:			suffer 1 hindrance while the grumbler is active  
After first sleepless night: 	suffer 1 hindrance at all times  
After third sleepless night:	suffer 2 hindrance at all times  
After a week:			lose 1 edge

### **Possession** {#possession}

This slow siege of the mind wears the victim down, making them hear voices and experience brief (non-game-effecting) hallucinations until their will is eroded. For each week, the victim gains a 0, 1, 2 hindrance against the possession, and against the exercise of control. After successful possession the victim may or may not continue to hear grumbling.

### **Control** {#control}

A possessing spirit may attempt to control the victim. The victim chooses whether to spend Effort on any action taken while under Control.

Victims with Liberated Mind may roll to resist, with appropriate assets if the action goes against the victim's ethos. Victims without defenses may only resist strong antithetical actions (eg attacking a PC they are loyal to) and generally gain no assets.

Examples of Control include failure to act, disable spending effort, put away weapon, hand an object to an enemy, walk instead of run, collapse, close your own eyes, look away.

## **\!Golemism\*** {#!golemism*}

The mage injects a soul into an inanimate object specially prepared to be a golem. Golems take independent action. Though sometimes cunning, they are seldom smart.

### **Creating** {#creating}

Reserve 3 Int points per Tier of the golem created. Making a golem has two parts. First, you must put the thing together. For this reason many prefer simple clay or wax because it is easy to shape. Second, the golem must be powered, as follows, by:

1. The soul tethered to operate them, with a tier matching that of the golem.  
2. The mage's soul, possessing the golem.

### **Killing** {#killing}

A golem acts like a malicious robot. Golems can be stopped by removing their blue crystal heart.

Every golem has immunities and weaknesses, plus one Undoing that is its particular weakness. Examples of Undoings might be:

* Reading the golem's name which is written on its forehead  
* Splashing it with water or fire  
* Never looking at it (thus it can not move)  
* Being confronted by its true nature, or someone it loves, etc.

### **Golem Plants** {#golem-plants}

If a Golemist also has Naturalism, then souls can be prompted to manipulate plants so that they become active, or even inserted into plants to "wake them up."

Effects:

- Low: Bushes pushing at creatures, grabbing them or blocking them  
- Low: Roots tripping or grabbing  
- Mid: Walking, sussurating plants  
- High: Plants that attack

## **\!Illuminism** {#!illuminism}

Spirits are "made of" light. This magic has to do with enabling tethered spirits to manifest as pure light (and sometimes sound), to make images, illusions or focused beams as you command.

* T1 Eyes Adjusted (e)  
* T1 Minor Illusion (i1)  
* T2 Cast Illusion (e)  
* T3 Burning Light (i3) \*5 dmg\*  
* Center of Attention  
* T4 Sunlight \- per CSR

## **\!Naturalism** {#!naturalism}

Souls: n/a  
This includes everything natural: plants, herbs, mushrooms, animals all can be made "more" than they are. Mushrooms acquire amazing effects. Animals can be trained into many tricks. Speaking with animals and plants. Etc.

Specifically this involved perceiving and communicating with the meta-spirits of species (eg the Spirit of All Terns). This is generally accessible in non-sophont species, and becomes more noticeable in sophont species when a high gh percentage of extant members are proximate, eg millions of humans or the few Mariners.

Creating: Naturalism requires the collecting and preparation of ingredients into appropriate forms: potions, injections, salves, inhaled dust, etc. Such preparation typically gives 1 Ease to the use of the form. The mage is connecting with the Master Soul of all plants of that variety.

Using: The form will dictate the usage: injecting, tossing, smearing or drinking. Note that non-biologicals are immune to all naturalism, and some biologicals will be immune to a form of delivery. For example, an entity that doesn't breathe is immune to inhaled dust.

Effects: The nature of the cypher will vary, as will onset times, but effects tend to include anything that we know chemicals can do to affect the body or brain, such as either producing or resisting:

- T1 Lack of smell or taste (i1)

## **\!Spectrism** {#!spectrism}

Souls: Light or Dark

Casting: Call upon a spirit to take an action, typically with a minor manifestation into the material world.

Effects: The kinds of things one can ask for are listed below. Some of these actions require the spirit to *strong manifest*, which tires a spirit out.

**Light or Dark Effects**

- **Move** a small, light object from one place to another  
- **Enshroud** a small object temporarily, explainable by overlooking or misplacing it  
- **Whisper** in an ear, explainable as "just hearing things"  
- **Distract** with noise or motion, usually by rattling something  
- **Unsettle** somebody with whispers or if the situation is already scary, **frighten**  
- **Queasy** like being kicked in the privates or punched in the gut, like an illness  
- **Deafen** somewhat, like a person putting a finger in your ear  
- **Misstep** or **Trip** to cause injury, as if clumsy  
- **Sudden Chills**  
- **Obstruct** a person's actions (-1 hinder), explainable through clumsiness  
- **Deliver** a substance created by Naturalism (the PC makes attack/damage rolls)  
- **Deliver** a cypher effect that is intended to be used on others

**Dark Effects**

- **Animate\*** its own bones with ease \- but not the bones of others; still child strength  
- **Vomit\*** like a manifest finger down the throat, explainable as illness  
- **Suffocate\*** somewhat, by covering the mouth and nose  
- **Dim Sight** limiting vision distance to 10'

- **Locked jaw**\* \- you may not speak nor put anything in your mouth.  
- **Swollen joints\*** \- speed edge reduced by 1

Items marked with \* are generally evil and will upset a spirit.

Abilities:

* Call Swarm (i4) \- assuming you've tethered a swarm spirit  
* Influence Swarm (i1) \- you may tether a swarm spirit

## **\!Witchery**

Souls: Light or Dark

Casting: Typically the weaving of spirit thread more than the direct manipulation of tethered spirits, though that can happen in a limited way. Black Witches can shackle spirits, but all witches typically tether or shackle at half their tier.

Witches are a sparse, world wide affiliation of completely independent women, all of whom are aware of the Corruptor, but all of whom, if they were to use their power openly, would be slain by their own community.

Witches use a kind of sympathy and brewery magic. Following tradition, most witch magic plays on emotions, and utilizes household items common around the world, such as needles and brooms.

All witches can:

* Communicate one to another in dreams, regardless of distance, but in great need  
* Travel great distances covertly on their flying brooms  
* Double their power during a full moon, but half it at a new moon

Witches have specialty gray magic that risks being used for evil, but when so used has knowable consequences:

* SEP fields and minor reality alteration  
* Destroying a nemesis with needles, wool and straw  
* Creating and using a sympathy doll (voodoo doll)  
* Charming people's minds by appealing directly to their spirit, but they realize it later  
* Brewing potions to effect the mind, like love potions

Other capabilities that are light include:

* Disrupt a spirit  
* Convince someone to enter into a bargain that mainly benefits the witch  
* While smoking subtly make a smokescreen for hiding or diversion  
* Plentiful Pot that can cause food for a few to feed many  
* Sacrificing ones' pool points to give to another, one for one

The medium through which a witches' power manifests differs greatly by culture, and includes significant variation. For exampke:

* Ekua through little carved or woven naturalistic totems  
* Moira through blarney  
* Meriwa through string figure weaving   
* Mariso through tattoos and face painting  
* Lavinia through tarot

17. **🝖** Amber \- **disrupts spirits** \- Since it is from before the corruptor, ancient amber is disruptive. Wool rubbed on amber to create an electric charge. Therefore, amber disrupts spirits (though it seldom eradicates them) putting them out of commission for a few rounds. It also pierces spirit cloaks, but has a damage maximum because it isn't as hard as metal.  
18. **KNOWN 🜺** Arsenic \- **magnifies bad luck** \- especially in crystal form, makes people vulnerable by hindrance 1 to dark spirits curse, possession, etc. and expands the range of bad luck.

* Changing to unnatural size.  
* Damage inflicted by magical energy or magical force, excepting light.  
* Telekinesis beyond about 15 pounds
