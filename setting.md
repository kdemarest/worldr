# Rule Britannia \- Setting

be they British citizens or colonial For our players, called by the crown

Science is putting Britain on the very cusp of the modern age. Optimism is high, yet troubling patterns of violence and cruelty cause some to doubt the benefits of newly empowered civilizing forces.

accompanied by odd red sunsets and alarming sunspots visible to the naked eye.

## Politics

The Congress of Vienna has pieced Europe back together. The major powers, Austria, Britain, Russia, Prussia and France, represented by an illuminati-like cabal of only five men, redraw Europe, make secret treaties, and impose new constitutions on the Germanic states and Switzerland.

**British Hegemony**: The British Empire is on the rise. While continental powers seek stability after Napoleon, British seafaring dominance is unquestioned, factories are creating wealth through export surpluses, and upcoming rail systems will enable both movement of products and governing an enormous empire.

France, now ruled by a [restored Louis XVIII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bourbon_Restoration#Second_Restoration_\(1815\)), is occupied by 1.2 million foreign soldiers, including 200,000 commanded by the Duke of Wellington. The White Terror, a purge by French ultra-royalists of old French revolutionaries and Napoleon supporters, is still fresh in the mind. England sees the flight or exile of numerous pro-Napoleon aristocrats.

Since 1809, Britain's West Africa Patrol, enhanced by Lord Castlereagh's inclusion of anti-slavery language into agreements at the Congress of Vienna, guards the entire west coast of Africa against the slave trade. Hundreds of slave trading ships are stopped, fined, or destroyed.

Sentiment about the French Revolution's evolution into Empire, and the return of the Bourbons, runs hot both for and against.

## British Instability

The Napoleonic wars, combined with the rising productivity of factories, creates instability in Britain. Economic differences become a sore point for many. As protests rise, habeas corpus is suspended and evidence-free arrests are common. The government uses agents provocateur to infiltrate or incite incidents so as to arrest malcontent leaders.

After 1816's [Spa Field Riots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spa_Fields_riots), in which the Tower of London was nearly captured, the leading Spenceans are arrested and tried for treason, but acquitted. [Luddites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luddite) destroy the [bobbinet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bobbinet) [lace machines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lace_machine) in John Heathcoat's Loughborough factory. All middle England is plagued by factory sabotage, and protestors are gunned down, culminating in ruthless repression and executions in 1816\.

In 1817, the [Blanketeers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blanketeers), a group of weavers hard hit economically, stage a 5,000 person march to present a petition to improve the cotton trade directly to the King. Growing to 25,000, they are brutally treated, arrested and questioned.

Not long after, a variety of workers attempt an insurrection at Pentrich, resulting in more arrests.

## Environment

Across Europe summer never arrives in full, with cold, heavy rains and strange, blood red sunsets. Horses begin to die in thousands as the damp oat harvest fails. Sunspots increasingly visible to the naked eye prompt the "Bologna Prophecy", which claims the spots will grow to extinguish the sun, breeding hysteria among a superstitious populace.

## **Science** ([history of science](https://ia800908.us.archive.org/25/items/historyofscindex00willuoft/historyofscindex00willuoft.pdf))

British life expectancy is only 37 (on average) years due to very high child mortality, disease and pollution, but somewhat higher for the wealthy classes.

In London, gas lights have just begun to light Westminster Bridge, the city center, and three theaters: the Lyceum, Covent Garden, and Drury Lane. The Stirling Engine has just been invented, following the creation of the first viable locomotive three years prior. Meteorology is just beginning as a science. Goethe's "Metamorphosis" is the state of the art in scientific thought.

The first iron bridge is built fifty years prior, but London Bridge is still a dilapidated wreck.

Deep fogs called "Pea Soupers" regularly obscure the London air due to both natural fog and burning of coal by homes and factories. 

## Classes

In Britain, the poorest children run wild in the streets or get corralled into the factories. Boys from better-off families attend fee-based schools or parish schools until the age of 12, and then apprentice to a craft. It will be sixty years before compulsory education to the age of ten.

Pocket watches are a sign of some wealth among the merchant class and ship's officers.

One can discern nobles by their clothing, their carriages, and their retinue. A rising merchant class, propelled by the expansion of Empire, is on display in the Public Houses, at the theater and doing business at the waterfront brokerages. Their sons attend Oxford, Cambridge, or St Andrews, while their daughters attend finishing school in hope of attracting a husband.

[Early 19th Century Slang](https://georgiarefugees.tripod.com/oldslang.htm)

## Crime

There is no local police force \- those wronged, and their friends, do the policing. An aged force of watchmen, called the Charlies, travels the streets with lanterns and cudgels, crying out the time. Magistrates determine cases without benefit of a jury, reluctantly, being elected but preferring generally not to spend much time on the matter. The death penalty exists, but 60% are pardoned by the king depending on those pleading for the prisoner. Women can "plead the belly", be examined by a Jury of Matrons, and execution is deferred until after birth, at which time most women are then pardoned.

Duelling will be banned in 1819, but it isn't yet.

## Sports

Cricket has been played in Britain and the Empire for 200 years, and has been codified for 70 years. Eleven years ago the Gentlemen vs Players match began, and despite accusations of occasional match fixing, continues annually as a crowd favorite. Learn the [Rules of Cricket](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHEIT32ZEVs) (in two minutes) to get more of the flavor.

## British Customs

The age of consent was 12 for girls and 14 for boys, but parental consent to marry by licence was needed for minors under the age of 21\.

## Thought

**Technological Optimism**: Optimism that technological progress based on reason dominates the upper classes. Hard lessons like poisonous radium wallpaper have yet to be learned.

**Resentment of Industrialization**: Many craftspeople resent the emergence of factories. The secret Luddite union performs sabotage on textile factories.

**Rational Thought**: Voltaire, Hume and Locke are the respected founders of a now widely-accepted Enlightenment thinking. Concepts like liberty, equality, progress, toleration, fraternity, constitutional government and separation of church and state continue to slowly emerge. Embraced by the common man, these philosophies trigger deadly revolutions, leading to opposition in thought between the noble elites and the working classes.

**Empiricism**: Now somewhat well understood, scientific data gathering is just beginning to yield true scientific knowledge in medicine and mechanisms, as well as bearing the mixed fruit of factory industrialization.

**Stratified Classes**: Nobles across Europe still hold most land, wealth and power. Intermarried ruling families still matter, but congresses as governing bodies increase their power.

Thought is transforming. Fifty years prior, the physician Julien La Mettrie has published "Man a Machine", the first assertion that man and soul are subject to physical laws rather than purely divine forces. He hypothesizes that one day an ape might learn language.

## Religion

The Church of England (Anglican) dominates British religious life, using the government to restrict Catholic worship, bar Catholics from holding public office and university positions, and bar them from voting or owning land. Anti-government or anti-church acts are frequently described as "Popish plots". 

## Fashion

Beau Brummel, [PIC](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9b/BrummellEngrvFrmMiniature.jpg/1200px-BrummellEngrvFrmMiniature.jpg), close friend of Prince Regent George IV, dominates male fashion. [PIC](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/proxy/UmJ1Thi44ZyNjofZ3I-V_qIeCKPaOQrNL8FrfNcl9_iE0H34ev54xw66H0dxCmEB-HOByR4hCloANtt6NHjlqXF7OdSlQRodVIxaKY2-Gb9Ddncg5cyFPLEeMsLmqIP8) Top hats with curved crests or brims, tight, high-waisted breeches with silk stockings, double-breasted vest coats and tails rule the day. A gentleman's cane is in every hand.

Ladies Regency fashion is embodied by the "Empire Silhouette" \- a dress with tight bodice and a high waist, made of soft, gauzy material, often tied with a ribbon or sash. Women's hair is in tight ringlets, above the ears. [PIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:%22Rutger_Jan_Schimmelpenninck_with_his_Wife_and_Children%22,_by_Pierre-Paul_Prud%27hon_\(1801-02\).jpg) Josephine Bonaparte was a figurehead for the Empire waistline, as her husband's rule harkened back to ancient Greece and Rome. For the first time in centuries, respectable but daringly fashionable women would leave the house without a hat or [bonnet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bonnet_\(headgear\)). But many still wore them. Naturally, all women wore gloves outside the house and used parasols to guard against the sun. The poorer classes had little interest in fashion, and more interest in food and shelter.

# Medicine

The concept that germs, especially in foul water, are the source of disease is unheard of. Cholera and Typhoid are likely carried by smell. The Thames is unclean, but has not yet achieved the Great Stink of 1850\. Edward Jenner's **smallpox vaccine** is saving thousands, while the radical Dr Pinel of France has struck off the literal shackles of the insane and begun treating them as sick people rather than demon possessed. Not so in London.

[Phrenology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phrenology) is on the rise, perceived as revolutionary, gaining is acceptance.

Masturbation is considered a huge sin, yet various medical practices climax women as antidotes for depression and other maladies.

Common Quack Practices

* **Tobacco smoke enemas** for drowning and other uses. Stations are set up all along the Thames for such treatments. [LINK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco_smoke_enema)  It declined (slowly) after 1811, when Benjamin Brodie demonstrated that nicotine is a cardiac poison.  
* **Leeches and bloodletting** are used for many ailments, like smallpox, epilepsy, and plague. Bloodletting is proved stupid by Alexander L Hamilton [LINK](https://www.jameslindlibrary.org/articles/alexander-lesassier-hamiltons-1816-report-of-a-controlled-trial-of-bloodletting/) but the result is ignored.  
* **Mummies** \- the human body is used as an ingredient in many medicines, including mummies for epilepsy, bruising, and hemorrhaging  
* **Mercury** is used to treat melancholy, syphilis, and influenza.  
* **Arsenic** for sleeping sickness and sexual diseases and disorders, and food storage.  
* **Collapsing the Lung** \- Tuberculosis and lung problems of all kinds used plombage to forcibly collapse the lung to improve healing.  
* **Excision** \- Stutter is sometimes treated by excising part of the tongue.  
* **Electrification** \- Electrotherapy was new in the 1700s, but it was used regularly until the early 1900s for illnesses like epilepsy, paralysis, impotence, tapeworms, and more. 

Quack Medicines

Narcotics

* Few pain-killers and zero knockout drugs exist  
* Opium is prevalent

* Mineral springs are highly regarded, and spas are well populated by the elite  
* Arsenic \- used for everything from ulcers to syphilis  
* Stramonium \- used for almost everything  
* Belladonna \- used by women to enlarge their pupils to be attractive, and for asthma  
* Various purgatives  
* Acids such a nitric acid

# Technology

These are just a couple notes for myself.

**The Mechanical Turk** tours Europe and the US, an automaton seemingly playing chess against human opponents. It is a sham. [Kempelen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolfgang_von_Kempelen)

Muskets \- hand loaded with lead balls

Egyptian Temples & Tombs (early 1800s) Napoleon’s Egyptian campaign (1798–1801) triggered systematic Western documentation. Description de l’Égypte (published 1809–1829) catalogued temples like Luxor, Karnak, Philae, Abu Simbel.

Ellora Caves (India). British colonial officers began systematic description around 1810–1817. The 34 rock-cut temples and monasteries (Hindu, Buddhist, Jain) astonished Europeans.

Borobudur \- In 1814, during the British administration of Java, Sir Thomas Stamford Raffles heard of this “hill” from locals. He sent an engineer, H.C. Cornelius, who spent weeks clearing vegetation and earth, revealing the monument. Raffles publishes History of Java in 1817\.

It would be interesting if the Inuit had Ammasslik maps. Although documented in 1885 they existed much earlier. And perhaps they mapped the underground spaces or obsidian tubes in this way.

Consider Byron's 1817 works. Manfred involves spirits and magic, dovetailing with the spirits Henton can perceive.

Napoleon imprisoned Pius VII (1809–1814). After Napoleon’s fall, the Pope was restored, and the Papacy’s prestige rose. By 1817 the papacy had been very recently restored and that had to have major ripple effects.

The Irish, having been recently merged with Britain in 1801, begin to push for Catholic emancipation. Moira no doubt knows Daniel O’Connell a **middle-aged barrister in Dublin** later instrumental in Catholic emancipation as a barrister.

The Holy Roman Empire was dissolved (1806). Napoleon reorganized German territories, secularizing many bishoprics and monasteries, ending the existence of "Prince Bishops"

Numerous countries including Spain, Russia, and Poland organized resistance to Napoleon in religious terms, increasing the glamour of the church. By 1820, religion was entangled with **nationalism and liberalism.**

Waldensians survived by retreating into the Alps, enduring centuries of repression. It might be interesting if our Irish witch had a sister who was Swiss French or something like that. In **1817**, the Waldensians were still very much alive, but confined to their Alpine valleys in Piedmont. They were marginalized, discriminated against, but **persisted as a distinct religious community**

**Carbonari (Italy, also France):** Secret societies of liberals/nationalists, anti-clerical, seeking constitutional government. Portrayed as conspiratorial, Satanic, “carbon-burners.”

**Drunken entertainment** for the wealthy young man included:

* Wrenching doorknockers off of doors, showing your virility and teasing you stodgy, also wealthy neighbors  
* "Boxing a Charlie", pushing over  the little huts the charlies used on dank foggy nights, tumbling them out and onto the ground. One might wait until the charlie kicked and screamed em to be let out.  
* Stealing anything not nailed down, like barbers poles, and having a "collections parlor" in your house for it.

The lesson here is that law didn't really apply to the elites, and it was social mores and the disapprobation of peers that kept them in line more than the law.

**Arithmometer** \- In Paris, a French officer turned insurance man named **Charles Xavier Thomas de Colmar** was quietly working on what he called the **Arithmometer**, a polished brass box about the size of a strong writing case. Across its top ran neat rows of sliding levers, each controlling hidden gearwork that could, with a few cranks, add, subtract, multiply, or divide faster than any clerk with pen and paper. To the eye it looked like a gentleman’s scientific instrument—gleaming brass, steel teeth, and enamelled number windows—but in practice it promised to turn columns of figures into answers with a mechanical certainty that seemed half-magical

# **World Order**

Five "Great Powers" exist in Europe. The Napoleonic wars are recently ended, resolved at Waterloo and with the restoration of monarchy at the Congress of Vienna. The remainder of the world is primitive, savage. America is small, recently possessed of the untamed Louisiana Territories from Napoleon.

## Background

Key elements in the world that matter to gameplay include:

* British empire and navy are strong  
* Completion of the Napoleonic wars and re-establishment of European monarchies  
* Strong egalitarian feelings across Europe generated by French thought and events  
* Slavery and the anti-slavery agreements at Vienna  
* Eruption of Mount Tambora creates the Year without a Summer, which continues  
* Recent scientific and medical innovations  
* Calcutta sees massive cholera outbreak

## Congress of Vienna

[DEETS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congress_of_Vienna)  
In 1815, to eradicate Napoleon and end 23 years of war, the Congress of Vienna was held, with these goals:

* Reinstating the "Ancient Regime" of monarchy  
* Carefully balanced power such that Europe would remain at peace.  
* Restrain or eliminate republicanism and revolution

New European boundaries were essentially drawn by only **five men**, despite many other rulers and representatives of lesser powers attending. France lost all Napoleonic gains to Russia, Prussia and Austria.

### **Drama at the Congress**

**Napoleon's Return** \- Negotiations continued despite the outbreak of fighting triggered by Napoleon's dramatic return from exile and resumption of power in France during the Hundred Days of March to July 1815\. The Congress's "final act" was signed nine days before his final defeat at Waterloo on 18 June 1815\.

**Polish-Saxon Crisis** \- Russia wanted most of Poland, but Austria and Britain feared this would make Russia much too powerful. Crafty Talleyrand proposed a solution: admit France to the inner circle, and France would support Austria and Britain. The three nations signed a secret treaty, agreeing to go to war against Russia and Prussia, if necessary. When the Tsar heard of the secret treaty he agreed to a compromise, getting only part of Poland.

## Britain

[MAP](https://www.loc.gov/resource/g5751a.ct006187/?r=-1.23,-0.396,3.245,1.805,0)  
Ruled by parliament and the often insane King George III, his son George IV steps in as Regent when he must, thus defining the so-called "Regency Era". George IV is seen as a lackadaisical dilettante by most, distracted by dandies like Beau Brummel

In Britain the Year without a Summer is causing famine. Reactionary Luddites sabotage burgeoning lace factories. Spencians [LINK](https://www.marxists.org/history/england/britdem/societies/spenceans/) (essentially egalitarian socialists inspired by the French Revolution) threaten the government and attack the Tower of London, meeting with ruthless suppression. Regular people, feeling unrepresented, rebel and this culminates in the Peterloo Massacre in 1819 and the Six Acts, a paranoid legal crackdown on the freedoms of the public and press.

The Pax Britannica begins, and the six ship West Africa Squadron patrols the entire west coast of Africa to interdict slave ships and enforce the no-slavery agreement of the Congress of Vienna.

Ireland suffers from famine, with many emigrating to London.

## Europe

There are five European "Great Powers", well understood as such in Britain. The "Great Powers" constituted the "[Concert of Europe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concert_of_Europe)" and claimed the right to joint enforcement of the postwar treaties

### **Austrian Empire**

Created 1804 by proclamation of the Habsburg Francis II. The third most populous European monarchy, ruling 240,000 square miles). It remained part of the Holy Roman Empire until the latter's dissolution in 1806\.
