What unseen forces shape the destinies of men and cast the very planets 'neath their sinister will?

The date is June 12, 1817.

Note: This campaign seeks to tread new ground. Despite the date, it is emphatically not steampunk. Its hidden theme is for only the GM to know, and the players to discover.

The British Empire, regarded by its citizens as the peak civilization of all time, spans the globe, driven by uncontested supremacy of the sea, economic colonialism abroad and the seeds of an industrial revolution at home.

Napoleon has been defeated by the Duke of Wellington at Waterloo, ending 23 years of continuous war that have shattered Europe. The Congress of Vienna, enacting the will of a mere five men, has restored Europe's balance by reinstating the Ancien Regime of noble rulership.

In the coming century the British Empire will quadruple in size, cresting at 500 million people, and governing a quarter of the planet's surface.

And yet, in the present day...

The British crown is troubled. The king is wracked by bouts of madness. The heir is an unserious fop. Gambling and debauchery at the royal palaces are his only true interest. And Princess Caroline, the darling of the people, has tragically passed in childbirth.

Adding to the tumult, Jacobites and Luddites sabotage both government and industry.  Bonapartist threats cross the channel. Pestilence wracks Ireland, and threatens England. Many thousands of soldiers and sailors, newly released after the Napoleonic wars, flood the streets. The Year without a Summer, 1816, shadowed by ash from distant Mt. Tambora, has left famine and strife in England. Cholera sweeps the Indian colonies so recently wrested from the Mughal empire.

At home, depending on one's social class, Londoners see both hardship and victory. Every day life continues.

This is the world our players enter. To them, the grandeur of the empire, and the troubles that beset it are merely as they appear. Nothing more.

But before the end everything they know will be re-cast in a revealing, eons-spanning, mind twisting light, and they themselves will be transformed in ways none of them yet imagine. Some for better, and some for worse.
The World

Is not England the Center of the Empire, and the Empire the center of the world?

What Kind of World is Rule Britannia?

Set on earth in 1817 the world can be considered the actual earth. To the average person history will seem to remain unchanged, but behind the scenes players will confront a baffling and sinister force whose true ends they must discover.

Important components of the world include:

Spirits are real
Present in all things, spirits linger, quests unfulfilled, in haunted places or unseen on the streets. Some few men are born attuned to this grim reality.

Technology is transforming understanding
The first ever vaccine, the proto-steam engine, gas streetlamps and copper clad Baltimore Clippers change lives in ways few expect.

Intrigue Abounds
Spies and plots whirl throughout Europe - Bonapartists, royalists, slavers, Irish revolutionaries, and more

Ancient Cultures hold deep mysteries
Primitive yet powerful nations still thrive. From Africa's Gold Coast, to the arctic, to distant sweltering Java, the British colonizers face deep unknowns. Yet what they hide may influence the destiny of the empire.

Social Order is Fragile
London has no formal police force, and the world is a wild, untamed place. Bold, courageous men can axhieve much.
The Player Characters
The core premise of the player characters is that they are staunch members of the British Empire during its ascent. They know their own superiority. They believe the British way is the civilized way.

Some players might choose non-British origins, but the campaign works best when some degree of colonial, empire-building hubris is at play. If somebody isn't suggesting tea after the party gets swarmed but supernatural rats, then the spirit of the campaign is missing.


GM Knowledge

What is the big secret?

A Dark Influence Lurks
Behind it all a corrupting force manipulates men as a spider trims a web, setting civilization against itself, bending events to unravel sentient humanity

The Spirit of the Campaign
Early in the game, and from time to time, make sure there is plenty of "normal life" to act as contrast for the following:
Discovery of wondrous, unsuspected places
The slow unravelling of tantalizing mysteries
Sudden blows of memorable horror

Pacing
There are many mysteries and clues to unravel, many places to explore, people and entities to meet. Let the core element come to light slowly. Boil the frog.

Cleansings (World Endings)
The Corruptor, having attempted natural extermination like Mt Tambora and deadening the mind by mixing humanity with creatures, has turned to using humanity to kill itself over long periods of time. The C has studied humanity in great, minute and aching detail. While it fails to see some human qualities (loyalty, love) it easily perceives many others that humanity chooses to stay ignorant of. It uses this model of the human mind to devise cleansings that humanity can bring upon itself.

Revelations gradually reveal these potential cataclysms to the players:

(I) Overheating	Cleansing by Filth
Carbon consumption driving climate change, started 1859. England's upcoming Industrial Revolution

(II) Pandemic		Cleansing by Life
Biotechnology & genetically modified organisms and engineered pandemic

(III) Torpor		Cleansing by Futility
Machinery/AI rendering humans purposeless by making them redundant.

(IV) War		Cleansing by Fire
Nuclear or molecular nanotechnology weapons

(V) Asteroid		Cleansing by Dust
A rock 12 miles wide hurtles towards earth. The impact will blot out the sun for decades.

(VI) EcoLapse	Cleansing by Vigor
Overpopulation driving consumption, commons abuse, and ecological collapse

(VII) Invasives	Cleansing by Competition
An invasive species, like carp and the Great Lakes, simply out-competes humanity.

Note: Overheating has the corollary effect of melting the Zocto Ice Wards.

Note: There have also been failed attempts to devise a cleansing. The Scroll of Changing is one example.
Destiny
Each player character has a role in forming the future of humanity.

Lucius		- bearer of the ring, time traveler helping everything align
Throckmorton	- development of technology with sustainability
Bolton		- develops a vision for civilization and proper command and governance
Henton		- breaks the binding of wakeful spirits to the material world
Gahan		- corrects the DNA deficiencies
Constance	- a Barabbas representing the buried dark side of humanity

"God believes that all life is sacred" the turning point for Constance.
Treating a human life trivially opened a huge, dangerous door
Lucius uses a cypher, and said "God believes all life is sacred."
Gelatinous mass, formerly nuno, is gone
They used nerossium to give Lucius longer, so are suffering bad luck.

The codes Lucius wrote to himself from the future.
Jupiter is the Key
Beware the seven Avatars (seemed to be "three" until reading bible)
Follow the word of Benedict (follow in a geographical sense)

Lucius realizes that his ability to write code in real time may be a safe method of communication.

TOMES

Tomes only exist because the C is proud of his subtlety. He feels his victory is the greater if he fully reveals his plans, confident that sentients are too stupid to see, too short-lived to stop him, and too selfish to avoid their end.

There are two types:
- apocalyptic tomes describe one of the apocalypses that will end how manity
- tool tomes reveal methods, like fracture and the cult of Purity.
DONE (I) TOME OF CLEANSING BY FILTH
From the Kumasi palace library, on a pedestal.

Let the deep ancients be exhumed. Set them ablaze to set the world ablaze. For are the five fingers not small, selfish, petty, mean, creatures? Ever their sight is short. Ever betraying their own when comfort, momentary desires and gratification are at stake. Ever blind beyond the bounds of their own flickering life; nay a decade; nay an hour is too long for such as these to hold back their greed for comfort, for safety, for power.

Life is struggle. Life is pain. Life's only purpose: to vanquish one's enemies and hear the lamentation of their women. Only by ruthless excision may safety be achieved. How blind they are not to see this! Tyranny, the only path to victory. Every star has a limit, for never shall it burn until the utter end of all time. And who shall harness the very stars? The victor.

Did not King David wear the fiery diamond of seven starred Jupiter? At the utter end there can be only one, and mankind shall never be that one.

So pull the ancients from the sand. Pull them from the sea. Pull them from the depths of the earth. Set them ablaze in service to man, who can not resist power, and let him craft his own cleansing. His very ruination.

Let the ancients burn and vomit their filth! By the time fiver fingers understand, it will be too late.  As the ice warms the very nature of the oceans shall change, extinguishing the life within. Hunger will drive them. From the equators will they flee, unto the barren desert poles. The blaze shall pursue them.

Then shall they know the subtlety of the Lord Most Sublime. Then shall their folly be made clear, but only at the most utter end, and they will expire in hopelessness and futility, raging at the weakness of their foolish nature

Outlines global warming as a path to eradicate humanity. By digging up the liquid bodies of the deep ancients (dinosaurs) and setting them ablaze to produce Filth. To set the world afire. In sanskrit the date is 1859. Which requires technology that uses the liquid. This results in the Apocalypse of Filth.

Dark Stars
The Dark Stars are black holes about a centimeter around encased in a diamond shell. Black holes were posited as "Dark Stars" by John Mitchell in 1783 based on Newton's theory of light. There is one such Dark Star, also called a Warding Heart, at the center of each Ward Storm.

As manipulators of light, Dark Stars are intimately connected to Ether and to the Spirit world.

The Wards are also known as the "seven stars in jupiter", and were given the names of arch-angels in Christianity; The names of the seven archangels who lead the angelic host are: Saint Michael, Saint Gabriel, Saint Raphael, Uriel, Raguel, Zerachiel, and Remiel.



King David is the metaphorical name of a human king who found one of the Warding Hearts and wore it, giving him great power over spirits.

(II) TOME OF CLEANSING BY LIFE
Pandemic that wipes out all human life. Possibly natural due to mega-population, but nore likely to be a biotechnology & genetically modified organism pandemic that gets out of control.
(III) TOME OF CLEANSING BY FUTILITY
Machinery/AI rendering humans purposeless
(IV) TOME OF CLEANSING BY FIRE
Outlines mining ooron to give humanity the atom bomb. Then the Tome of Fracture does the rest. This results in the Apocalypse of Fire.
(V) TOME OF CLEANSING BY DUST
Tells of the "long work" of finding and then redirecting Daphne, a 12 mile wide former moon of Jupiter. The interior is ice. By splitting the hydrogen from the oxygen, an ad-hoc thruster was created that is moving it into slingshot orbits that will eventually reach earth.
(VI) TOME OF CLEANSING BY VIGOR
Overpopulation driving consumption, commons abuse, and ecological collapse
TOME OF FRACTURE
Outlines how to fracture mankind with faith, with tribalism, and the necessity of exalting leaders who derive power from division using the Great Tools hate and fear. Exalt his puppets the prophets. Let none see beyond family, beyond tribe. It describes the British Empire as an abomination 
DONE TOME OF FAITH
Yay the Cult of Purity shall further the will of Him most sublime, as the hammer and the chisel shape the stone, or reduce it to dust. In faith, they feel they are the hammer.

Yet, in truth, are they not a shield? As a shield shall they be, for a time comes when all with knowledge must conflict. It is destined, and those who act first act best. All delay, all parley, all suits for peace, are vain, but a tool in the hand of Him most Sublime.

Carefully they were built. Carefully were their beliefs chosen from the panoply of sentient thought, woven together. Did not the Sublime Lord study well, and understanding their frail minds, find a seductive path for feet to follow.

For the right mind, unprepared, their arms are open wide to receive the sublime lie. It is belief, faith, wholly welcomed by those vulnerable, that connects and interweaves the newly faithful in strength and unity of purpose.

Praise hatred of the other, driven by fear of the unknown, surmounted by the compulsion for purity. Purity! Worthiness! It is in their nature. Yet so easily twisted. The comforts of family drive them, yet torn down such can be remade. Made anew! Now exalted! Chosen!

Who understands the weakness of humanity? The impurity? The failures and cruelty? The yearnings? We are all saddened by what must be done, yet, only we perceive The Answer, for we are chosen. Chosen by god as the hand that weilds the hammer.

Is our family not special? Do we not have exalted purpose? True justice! A righteous cause! Only we can cleanse the impurity.

Is it not delectable, to turn your enemy upon himself

Explicitly describes how the creation of the Cult of Purity was astroturfed as living tools to further the will of the Lord most Sublime. And his will is extinction to secure himself from encroachment by humanity.

Describes how the religious principles harmonize with what the C has learned of human nature, combined with the Wards, to make belief in the necessity of extinction of humanity palatable.

Alludes the inevitable deep future in which sentients must conflict for supremacy, so the only course is to gain victory now through extinction. All sentients have a central mind which, should it become aware of the C, will attack. So the C only wars in secret.
Scroll of Changing
PIC 
This evil scroll details how to bind sentient and animal spirits into an abomination, transforming them into a mix of the two creatures. It describes itself as an experiment by Him Most Sublime as a method of Cleansing, but it lacks some criteria: It is not inevitable. It requires too much work. It does not sufficiently spit in the eye of the enemy. Burning or otherwise destroying this scroll causes it to appear as a tattoo on the back of whoever destroyed it.

The circle in the upper right looks like it recedes away, each ring smaller than the prior. Maybe it is a tube that recedes away. If you have a way, you can keep reading what it says as it descends.
Fodder - Galvanism
Electric Kiss
Parties were held around Europe in which an attractive young lady was invited to stand on a block of insulating resin, and she was given a moderate static charge from a spinning globe. A young man from the audience was then invited to give her a kiss, and, in the process, the pair received a reasonable shock.

Beatification eg a kings crown under a rather large prime Conductor.
Corpse Reanimation
Dr Galvani believed that if he stimulated the fluid that connected the nerves to the entire body, he could reverse the effects of death. His nephew, Aldini, applied electrical impulses to the corpses using a battery, the animals’ heads would shake from side to side, their eyeballs would roll, and their tongues would roll out of their mouths.

Giovanni Aldini, nephew to Dr. Galvani, did electric experiments on severed ox heads and human corpses of the convicted. Known to the players as "Galvanism" which eventually became synonymous with using electricity to reanimate a corpse (contrasted with Voltism which believed that using different kinds of metals would generate electricity, without understanding that a catalyst was required)

Mary Shelley heard of these experiments...

At some point we have to have some kind of a dead face getting animated by electricity to appears if it is speaking blinking and making facial expressions. Gruesome but clearly necessary to

Aldini even, unbelievably, did an experiment where he treated depression with electricity and direct stimulation to the brain. And it worked. Unbelievable.

The players should encounter some kind of moment where either a light and jar or a voltaic battery is used to keep someone alive by direct stimulation to the heart.

For Cabot: Giacomo di San Genesio (died 25 July 1492) was an Italian-Jewish physician. In 1492, Cardinal Rodrigo Borgia called on Giacomo to care for the dying Pope Innocent VIII, who was sick with fever; Cardinal Giuliano Della Rovere claimed that inviting a Jew to the Vatican was blasphemy. San Genesio had the Pope drink the blood of three ten-year-old boys in the world's first blood transfusion, but this failed, as the Pope died on 25 July 1492. That same day, Della Rovere had an assassin stab him in the chest with his dagger, before another assassin approached him from behind and slit his throat.

British policy in Asia during the 19th century was chiefly concerned with expanding and protecting its hold on India, viewed as its most important colony and the key to the rest of Asia.[27] The East India Company drove the expansion of the British Empire in Asia. The company's army had first joined forces with the Royal Navy during the Seven Years' War, and the two continued to cooperate in arenas outside India: against the French campaign in Egypt and Syria, the capture of Java from the Netherlands in 1811, the acquisition of Singapore in 1819 and Malacca in 1824, and the First Anglo-Burmese War in 1826.

Just as dawn began to glow
There arose from the horizon a black cloud.
The Sublime Lord rumbled deep within,
And before him went Subjugation and Submission,
Heralds hastening over mountain and land.

The lord of destruction lifted all the seas,
Forth went War who made the roiling waters flow.

The Sublime lifted up their torches,
Setting the land ablaze with their burning.

Stunned night overtook the heavens,
And turned to blackness all that had been light.
The Sublime Lord shattered the land like a raging bull,
Broke it into pieces like a delicate pot.

All day long the South Wind blew,
With a fury like an avalanche,
And then the Flood came,
Overwhelming the people like an attack.

No one could see his fellow,
They could not recognize each other in the torrent.

The Lord Sublime cast his face upon it,
And he knew that peace was now upon Him.

Six days and seven nights
Came the wind and flood,
The storm flattening the land.

When the seventh day arrived,
the storm was pounding.
She who had been struggling with itself like a woman writhing in labor,
the sea, calmed; the whirlwind fell still; the flood stopped.

[133] I looked around all day long - quiet had set in
and all the human beings had turned to clay!

Rule Britannia - Setting




be they British citizens or colonial For our players, called by the crown

Science is putting Britain on the very cusp of the modern age. Optimism is high, yet troubling patterns of violence and cruelty cause some to doubt the benefits of newly empowered civilizing forces.

accompanied by odd red sunsets and alarming sunspots visible to the naked eye.

1817 in the United Kingdom
1816 in the United Kingdom

English Language Idioms of the 19th Century
Politics

The Congress of Vienna has pieced Europe back together. The major powers, Austria, Britain, Russia, Prussia and France, represented by an illuminati-like cabal of only five men, redraw Europe, make secret treaties, and impose new constitutions on the Germanic states and Switzerland.

British Hegemony: The British Empire is on the rise. While continental powers seek stability after Napoleon, British seafaring dominance is unquestioned, factories are creating wealth through export surpluses, and upcoming rail systems will enable both movement of products and governing an enormous empire.

France, now ruled by a restored Louis XVIII, is occupied by 1.2 million foreign soldiers, including 200,000 commanded by the Duke of Wellington. The White Terror, a purge by French ultra-royalists of old French revolutionaries and Napoleon supporters, is still fresh in the mind. England sees the flight or exile of numerous pro-Napoleon aristocrats.

Since 1809, Britain's West Africa Patrol, enhanced by Lord Castlereagh's inclusion of anti-slavery language into agreements at the Congress of Vienna, guards the entire west coast of Africa against the slave trade. Hundreds of slave trading ships are stopped, fined, or destroyed.

Sentiment about the French Revolution's evolution into Empire, and the return of the Bourbons, runs hot both for and against.

British Instability

The Napoleonic wars, combined with the rising productivity of factories, creates instability in Britain. Economic differences become a sore point for many. As protests rise, habeas corpus is suspended and evidence-free arrests are common. The government uses agents provocateur to infiltrate or incite incidents so as to arrest malcontent leaders.

After 1816's Spa Field Riots, in which the Tower of London was nearly captured, the leading Spenceans are arrested and tried for treason, but acquitted. Luddites destroy the bobbinet lace machines in John Heathcoat's Loughborough factory. All middle England is plagued by factory sabotage, and protestors are gunned down, culminating in ruthless repression and executions in 1816.

In 1817, the Blanketeers, a group of weavers hard hit economically, stage a 5,000 person march to present a petition to improve the cotton trade directly to the King. Growing to 25,000, they are brutally treated, arrested and questioned.

Not long after, a variety of workers attempt an insurrection at Pentrich, resulting in more arrests.

Environment

Across Europe summer never arrives in full, with cold, heavy rains and strange, blood red sunsets. Horses begin to die in thousands as the damp oat harvest fails. Sunspots increasingly visible to the naked eye prompt the "Bologna Prophecy", which claims the spots will grow to extinguish the sun, breeding hysteria among a superstitious populace.

Science (history of science)

British life expectancy is only 37 (on average) years due to very high child mortality, disease and pollution, but somewhat higher for the wealthy classes.

In London, gas lights have just begun to light Westminster Bridge, the city center, and three theaters: the Lyceum, Covent Garden, and Drury Lane. The Stirling Engine has just been invented, following the creation of the first viable locomotive three years prior. Meteorology is just beginning as a science. Goethe's "Metamorphosis" is the state of the art in scientific thought.

The first iron bridge is built fifty years prior, but London Bridge is still a dilapidated wreck.

Deep fogs called "Pea Soupers" regularly obscure the London air due to both natural fog and burning of coal by homes and factories. 

Classes

In Britain, the poorest children run wild in the streets or get corralled into the factories. Boys from better-off families attend fee-based schools or parish schools until the age of 12, and then apprentice to a craft. It will be sixty years before compulsory education to the age of ten.

Pocket watches are a sign of some wealth among the merchant class and ship's officers.

One can discern nobles by their clothing, their carriages, and their retinue. A rising merchant class, propelled by the expansion of Empire, is on display in the Public Houses, at the theater and doing business at the waterfront brokerages. Their sons attend Oxford, Cambridge, or St Andrews, while their daughters attend finishing school in hope of attracting a husband.

Early 19th Century Slang

Crime

There is no local police force - those wronged, and their friends, do the policing. An aged force of watchmen, called the Charlies, travels the streets with lanterns and cudgels, crying out the time. Magistrates determine cases without benefit of a jury, reluctantly, being elected but preferring generally not to spend much time on the matter. The death penalty exists, but 60% are pardoned by the king depending on those pleading for the prisoner. Women can "plead the belly", be examined by a Jury of Matrons, and execution is deferred until after birth, at which time most women are then pardoned.

Duelling will be banned in 1819, but it isn't yet.


Sports
Cricket has been played in Britain and the Empire for 200 years, and has been codified for 70 years. Eleven years ago the Gentlemen vs Players match began, and despite accusations of occasional match fixing, continues annually as a crowd favorite. Learn the Rules of Cricket (in two minutes) to get more of the flavor.

British Customs
The age of consent was 12 for girls and 14 for boys, but parental consent to marry by licence was needed for minors under the age of 21.

Thought

Technological Optimism: Optimism that technological progress based on reason dominates the upper classes. Hard lessons like poisonous radium wallpaper have yet to be learned.

Resentment of Industrialization: Many craftspeople resent the emergence of factories. The secret Luddite union performs sabotage on textile factories.


Rational Thought: Voltaire, Hume and Locke are the respected founders of a now widely-accepted Enlightenment thinking. Concepts like liberty, equality, progress, toleration, fraternity, constitutional government and separation of church and state continue to slowly emerge. Embraced by the common man, these philosophies trigger deadly revolutions, leading to opposition in thought between the noble elites and the working classes.

Empiricism: Now somewhat well understood, scientific data gathering is just beginning to yield true scientific knowledge in medicine and mechanisms, as well as bearing the mixed fruit of factory industrialization.

Stratified Classes: Nobles across Europe still hold most land, wealth and power. Intermarried ruling families still matter, but congresses as governing bodies increase their power.

Thought is transforming. Fifty years prior, the physician Julien La Mettrie has published "Man a Machine", the first assertion that man and soul are subject to physical laws rather than purely divine forces. He hypothesizes that one day an ape might learn language.
Religion
The Church of England (Anglican) dominates British religious life, using the government to restrict Catholic worship, bar Catholics from holding public office and university positions, and bar them from voting or owning land. Anti-government or anti-church acts are frequently described as "Popish plots". 
Fashion
Beau Brummel, PIC, close friend of Prince Regent George IV, dominates male fashion. PIC Top hats with curved crests or brims, tight, high-waisted breeches with silk stockings, double-breasted vest coats and tails rule the day. A gentleman's cane is in every hand.

Ladies Regency fashion is embodied by the "Empire Silhouette" - a dress with tight bodice and a high waist, made of soft, gauzy material, often tied with a ribbon or sash. Women's hair is in tight ringlets, above the ears. PIC Josephine Bonaparte was a figurehead for the Empire waistline, as her husband's rule harkened back to ancient Greece and Rome. For the first time in centuries, respectable but daringly fashionable women would leave the house without a hat or bonnet. But many still wore them. Naturally, all women wore gloves outside the house and used parasols to guard against the sun. The poorer classes had little interest in fashion, and more interest in food and shelter.

Medicine

The concept that germs, especially in foul water, are the source of disease is unheard of. Cholera and Typhoid are likely carried by smell. The Thames is unclean, but has not yet achieved the Great Stink of 1850. Edward Jenner's smallpox vaccine is saving thousands, while the radical Dr Pinel of France has struck off the literal shackles of the insane and begun treating them as sick people rather than demon possessed. Not so in London.

Phrenology is on the rise, perceived as revolutionary, gaining is acceptance.

Masturbation is considered a huge sin, yet various medical practices climax women as antidotes for depression and other maladies.

Leeches and bloodletting are used for many ailments, like smallpox, epilepsy, and plague. Bloodletting is proved stupid by Alexander L Hamilton LINK but the result is ignored.
Mummies - the human body is used as an ingredient in many medicines, including mummies for epilepsy, bruising, and hemorrhaging
Mercury is used to treat melancholy, syphilis, and influenza.
Arsenic for sleeping sickness and sexual diseases and disorders, and food storage.
Collapsing the Lung - Tuberculosis and lung problems of all kinds used plombage to forcibly collapse the lung to improve healing.
Excision - Stutter is sometimes treated by excising part of the tongue.

Ideas to add:

Petra was "Rediscovered” by the West in 1812 when Swiss explorer Johann Ludwig Burckhardt disguised himself as an Arab to gain access.

Rosetta stone found 1799, brought to Britain 1800, Champollion’s breakthrough came in 1822.

Egyptian Temples & Tombs (early 1800s) Napoleon’s Egyptian campaign (1798–1801) triggered systematic Western documentation. Description de l’Égypte (published 1809–1829) catalogued temples like Luxor, Karnak, Philae, Abu Simbel.

Ellora Caves (India). British colonial officers began systematic description around 1810–1817. The 34 rock-cut temples and monasteries (Hindu, Buddhist, Jain) astonished Europeans.

Borobudur - In 1814, during the British administration of Java, Sir Thomas Stamford Raffles heard of this “hill” from locals. He sent an engineer, H.C. Cornelius, who spent weeks clearing vegetation and earth, revealing the monument. Raffles publishes History of Java in 1817.

Thomas Robert Malthus – Essay on the Principle of Population (5th ed. 1817, widely influential)

Edmund Burke "reflections" as a response to French revolution and the te-instatement of monarchy at the Congress of Vienna.
Tradition over Abstract Rights
The Value of Prejudice (in the old sense)
Skepticism of Popular Sovereignty
Social Order and the Nobility
Fear of Violence and Anarchy

It would be interesting if the Inuit had Ammasslik maps. Although documented in 1885 they existed much earlier. And perhaps they mapped the underground spaces or obsidian tubes in this way.

Consider Byron's 1817 works. Manfred involves spirits and magic, dovetailing with the spirits Henton can perceive.

In 1816 Lady Frances Wedderburn-Webster and Byron ended their illicit affair, leading to his famous "When We Two Parted". She went on to meet Wellington, and in a few years he will nearly he drawn into a fuel over it 

New Madrid Earthquakes (1811–1812, Missouri Territory, USA) Magnitude: Series of very large quakes, M 7–8 Reversed flow of the Mississippi River briefly. Created Reelfoot Lake in Tennessee

Napoleon imprisoned Pius VII (1809–1814). After Napoleon’s fall, the Pope was restored, and the Papacy’s prestige rose. By 1817 the papacy had been very recently restored and that had to have major ripple effects.

The Irish, having been recently merged with Britain in 1801, begin to push for Catholic emancipation. Moira no doubt knows Daniel O’Connell a middle-aged barrister in Dublin later instrumental in Catholic emancipation as a barrister.

The Holy Roman Empire was dissolved (1806). Napoleon reorganized German territories, secularizing many bishoprics and monasteries, ending the existence of "Prince Bishops"

Numerous countries including Spain, Russia, and Poland organized resistance to Napoleon in religious terms, increasing the glamour of the church. By 1820, religion was entangled with nationalism and liberalism.

Waldensians survived by retreating into the Alps, enduring centuries of repression. It might be interesting if our Irish witch had a sister who was Swiss French or something like that. In 1817, the Waldensians were still very much alive, but confined to their Alpine valleys in Piedmont. They were marginalized, discriminated against, but persisted as a distinct religious community

Carbonari (Italy, also France): Secret societies of liberals/nationalists, anti-clerical, seeking constitutional government. Portrayed as conspiratorial, Satanic, “carbon-burners.”
Drunken entertainment for the wealthy young man included:
Wrenching doorknockers off of doors, showing your virility and teasing you stodgy, also wealthy neighbors
"Boxing a Charlie", pushing over  the little huts the charlies used on dank foggy nights, tumbling them out and onto the ground. One might wait until the charlie kicked and screamed em to be let out.
Stealing anything not nailed down, like barbers poles, and having a "collections parlor" in your house for it.
The lesson here is that law didn't really apply to the elites, and it was social mores and the disapprobation of peers that kept them in line more than the law.

Arithmometer - In Paris, a French officer turned insurance man named Charles Xavier Thomas de Colmar was quietly working on what he called the Arithmometer, a polished brass box about the size of a strong writing case. Across its top ran neat rows of sliding levers, each controlling hidden gearwork that could, with a few cranks, add, subtract, multiply, or divide faster than any clerk with pen and paper. To the eye it looked like a gentleman’s scientific instrument—gleaming brass, steel teeth, and enamelled number windows—but in practice it promised to turn columns of figures into answers with a mechanical certainty that seemed half-magical
